We have then in the ratiosa trustworthy means of identi-
fying ancient Greek intervals with their modern equivalents
and of realizing the sinc of those intervals which are not
recognired in our modern Enropean system. We are forced to
seek other causes for the great number of dissonant intervals
which we find in the theory of Greek music than supposed
defects in the instruments of measurement.

We have already seen that the facility with which the con-
sonant intervals may be accurately ternod, or perhaps it would
be better to say the artistic necessity to tune them acourately,
is a guarantee that any fluctuations in their measnrsd size are
, due to the measurements and not to any variatione in their
real siae, and that, since no such fluctuations are recorded
even when the experimenters professed to make the finest of
distinctions, it is reasonable to conclude that all the measure·
ments were made with the degree of care and precision
claimed for them. The other side of this characteristic
difference between consonant and dissonant intervals is the

· difficulty of tuning the latter with precision and the absence

of any necessity for great precision. This we consider to
have been a much more fertile cause of variations in their
recorded siae than any impossibility of eliminating errors due
to the measuring apparatus. In the case of instrumenta
which require frequent tuning, such as the lyre and other
stringed instrumenta, much evidently depende on the ear for
pitch-differenoes of the individual performer. In the caseos

instrumenta whose tones are fixed in pitch at the time of -

manufactum, like the αὐλός and fingered stringed instrumente
when their toncs depsnd on fixed frets along the finger-board,
the same personal clement enters in the (original) tuning of
the instrument, and is complicated by the fact that the pitch
of the notes¹ could be regulated during the performance by
the force of the breath in the case of wind-instrumenta and
by pressure on the string behind the frets of fingered stringed
instrumente, and in other ways. And in vocal music this
difficulty of tuning notes at dissonant intervals from one
