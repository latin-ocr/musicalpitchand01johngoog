these intervals were tuned witha far greater degree of accu-
racy than was possible in the case of the dissonant intervals.
The consonant intervals at least were fixed in point of sine.
That is to say, we may be sure that all the ancient phil-
osophers who undertoolr tc measure the sine cf the διὰ
πασῶν, διὰ πέντε, and the other consonances were measuring
exactly the same magnitudes in all cases, and that these

magnitudes are the same as the pitchdifferenoes which we call
Octave, Fifth, etc. But there is no discrepancy in the
reported ratics for these intervals. We are not told by one
that the ratio for the Octave is 50 2100, by another that it is
50:101. We are led to conclude either that the defects in
the instruments used for the finer measurements were not
serious, or that the ancient theorists were sc impressed with
the necessity that the perfect ‹nnscnances should have the
simpler and more perfect ratios as to peraist in ignoring
inoonvenient variatione in the results, even while they dis-
eonrsed of intervals which differed in size by only the twelsth

cfa Semitcne. The first alternative seems preferable. For -

if the Greek monoohord was accurate enough to allow experi-
menters to distinguish between intervals which differed by
only this small amount, then their measurements for the
Fcurth‚ for instance, cannot have been wrong by an amount
equal tc or greater than that difference, unless we suppose
them to be so dishcnest as to suppress its existence.

It wonld accordingly seem to follow that we must ascribe
the same degree cf accuracy to the measurements cf dissonant
intervals as to those of the consonances, so far as concerns the
determinationes their aize after they have been tuned. If it
is reported on good authority that the siae of acertain inter-
val is given hya certain ratic, we are not at liberty to ignore
this evidence, and no matter how unusual the interval may
seem tc our ears when it is produced mechanically from the
ratic, we must concede that the interval intended by the
ancient theorist cannot have differed appreciably from the
interval thus reprodnced.
