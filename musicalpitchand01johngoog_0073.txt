The number 27 10, then, derived from the numbers 216 and ·
243, used to express the ratio of the Tone which stands next
to the Leimma when whole numbers are used to illustrate the
- diatonic division 01 the tetrachord (Fourth) used in the scales
of the Timaeus.

The series given above is found in a number 01 the commen-
taries on the double quaternion (e. 9, Theo Smyrnaeus, de mus,
0. 14, p. 67,10, aq. Hiller ; Plutarch, de caim. procu, c. 18,
1021 E, sq.; Nicomachus, eccerpto, 2, p. 30 Meib. (p. 267
Κ. v. J .)),¹ and is sufficient when a single tetrachord is under
consideration. But when a whole Octave of the binary soele
is expressed in whole numbers andthe second Leimma appears,
it is necessary to double the numbers which make up the series.
This gives: 384 (Tene) 432 (Tone) 486 (Leimma) 512² for the
first tetrachord. Theon gives this series (100. cit, p. 68, ο, sq.
Hiller), and mentions the objection 10 11 that it does not give
the ratio given by Plato for the Leimma, 243 : 266, with its
difference 13 ; but, as he truly remarks, the ratio of the Leimma
may be expreesed in other numbers, as 486 0512. Chapter,¹

16 of Plutarch's de onim. procr. (1019 E, sq.) gives the process ’
by which these numbers are obtained. If 384 10 taken for the
first term of the binary and ternary scales, all the following

terms in both the branches can be expressed in whole numbers.³

¹In Plato small numbers represent acute sonnds, and the scales run
downward from unitv, so that the Leimmata are at the grave end of the
tetrachords; but in Plutarch and Nicomachus the reverse is the case, and
the Leimma in each tetrachord stands above the Tenes (Plut, 100. cit, 1021
F: τοῦ γὰρ βαρυτέρου τόνῳ ἐπιταθέντος, ὅπερ ἐστὶν ἐπόγδοον, γίγνεται σις’·
τούτου πάλιν τόνῳ ἄλλῳ ἐπιταθέντος, γίγνεται σμγ’· . . . . (1022 Α) περίεστι
τοῦ ὅλον διάστημα λοιπὸν rh μεταξὺ τῶν σμγ’ καὶ τῶν σνς’, τὰ τρισκαίδεκα·
διὸ aul λεῖμμα τοῦτον τὸν ἀριθμὸν ὠνόμαζον. Nisam„ loc. cit, ἐπιτείνουσι).
The same 00101 figures can illustrate these two situations according as they
stand for length oi stringor for vibration numbers. Os. Theonem Smyr-
naeum, p. 65, ιο Hiller.

²rhe whole series is: 384-432—486-512-576-648-729-768.
