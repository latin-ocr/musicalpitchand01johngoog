have only to point tc the fact that their written accente express
thie risc and fall in pitch. It was natural then that a com-
parison should be instituted between the formal melody of
vocal music and that more subtle melody which existe in con-
versational speech. It ie also important to remember that the
voice held a predominant position in Greek music, possibly
due quite as much to the inferiority of the musical instrumente
of the anciente as to any greater appreciation of the capabili-
ties of the voice on their part.

Aristoxenus ie now ready to describe the φθόγγος (musical . 1

eound), having prepared the way for it by his discussion of the
two sorte os κίνησις. He says (Ham, 1. ἓ 31, p. 12 Meib.)=
κινεῖται μὲν γὰρ (ἡ φωνὴ) ἐν τῷ διάστημά τι ποιεῖν, ἵσταται
δ’ ἐντῷ φθόγγῳ. The stopping places of κίνησις διαστηματική
are φθόγγοι. At p. 15 Meib. there is a different definition
(see below, p. 27).

We have noticed (p. 18) that the ‘continuone movement'
Ι of the voice, as described by Aristoxenus, does not include a
gradual change of pitch, if bounded by fixed degrees of pitch.
The treatment may be said to be faulty to that extent. In
fact, the difference between the two kinds of motion, when
analyned‚ turns out to be more a difference of steadiness and
unsteadiness in pitch than simply a difference in the manner
in which it may change from acute to grave and cicc owed.
In κίνησις συνεχής the pitch is nowhere steady and is always
varying; in κίνησις διαστηματική it is steady now at this
height, now at that, and never varies except by leaps. The
sounds which constitute the former are then to be found in
the class of sounds commonly styled ‘non-musical‚' those
which constitute the latter, in the ‘musical' class.l

Although no provision is made sor gradual change in pitch
bounded by fixed degrees of pitch-inaword, for portamento—
