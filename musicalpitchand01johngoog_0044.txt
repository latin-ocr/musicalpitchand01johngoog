sound apert from its connection with other musical sounds.
The terme ἐμμελής and ἐκμελής, used both cf notes them-
selves aud ol the intervals formed by the notes, signify that
they are unable or unusable in the same pioee cf music. One
note is ἐκμελής with regard tc another note, if the interval
between them is not one which can occur in actual music,
although it might be used in speech. For example, a note
which should divide the interval cl a semitono into two small
intervals would be ἐκμελής in modern European music.
Ptolemy divides φθόγγοι into the two classes οῖ ἐμμελεῖς and
οῖ ἐκμελεῖς.

Ptolemy, Horra, 1. iv.‚ p. 9Wallis: εῖσῖ δὲ ἐμμελεῖς μὲν
ὅσοι συναπτόμενον πρὸς ἀλλήλους εὔφωνοι (or εὔφορον) τυγχά-
νουσι πρὸς ἀκοήν. ἐκμελεῖς δὲ ὅσοι μὴ οὕτως ἔχουσι. (lom-
pare Porphyry, commodatius, p. 265 Wallis, and p. 215.

Gaudentius, alter speaking of the two kinds of φωνή, the
συνεχής aud the διοσοημοτική, says (hortu. iotrcd„ 1, p. 2
Meib. (p. 328 K. v. J )) ἰδίως δὲ τῆς διοπημοτινοῆς τὸ μὲν
ἐμμελές, τὸ δὲ ἐκμελές· τὸ μὲν ῥητοῖς χρώμενον διαστήμασι
eccl μηδὲν ἀπολειπόμενον ἢ ὑπερβάλλον αὐτὸ ἐμμελές, τὸ δὲ
ἐνδεὲς ἡ ὑπερβάλλον μικρρῖ τῶν ὡρισμένων διαστημάτων
ἐκμελές. And further cn (ictu. 3, p. 4 Meib. (p. 330, ιι K.
v. J )) τῶν δὲ διαστημάτων τὰ μέν ἐστιν ἐμμελῆ, τὰ δ’ ἐκμελῆ.
τῶν δ’ ἐμμελῶν τὰ μὲν σύμφωνα, τὰ δὲ ἀσύμφωνα, xre.

These terme are then more appropriately applied to the
intervals than to the notes, for it is evident that every ocn-
oeivable degree of pitoh can be used in melody if the hey-note
be auitably pitohed.¹
κ The term ἑμμελής ἰε also used in nearly the same sense as

διωημοτικός as opposed to συνεχής (see above, p. 18).
