Again, the Pythagorean School 01 musical theorists, more
mathematically inclined than their 000000010, 1100 Aristoxe-
neans‚ consistently denied that the Filth and Fourth were
00001103) 0001 2} Tones respectively. But 0010 modern
theory these incontrovertible 10010 00001100 consciously 00 un-
consciously ignored, so in the ancient musical world we find
the Aristoxenean School using the Semitone, defined 0010011
01 1100 Whole-tone (which 10100010 defined as the difference
, between the Fisth and the Fourth) aa a unit for the measure-
ment of 011 other intervals. It 10 inconvenient, 10 say the
least, 10 10ον0 no unit supplied by nature, and for the purposea
01 0 practical 00101100 some 000101 00 approximate unit would
seem to be almost 0 necessity 100 0 music developed 10 the
0010101 demanding different keys and modes. In teaching,
moreover, it is very desirable to be able to regard that scale
(with us the chromatio) 10 which progressionis madeby the
amallest steps recognized, 00 composed 01 equal-sized intervals.

For rougher measurements, then, we 000 fully justified in
assuming 00 0 0011 whatever interval we find 00001 convenient
100 1100 purpose. The sizo 01 00010 00 interval will, 01 course,
depend on the nature of the music concerned. Thus in Hindu
Music the Octave 10 regarded as consisting 01 22 small intervals
(000110), 00010 11001 0100 01 110000 make 0 Fourth and thirteen
a Fifth, and consequently four make the Major Whole-tone.
In Arabian Music 17 approximately equal intervals compose
the Octavc. But ancient Greek Music, like modern European
Music, recognizes an Octava 01 12 nominally equal small
1010000010(ἡο006000, 8000110000) 01 which five make up the ·
Fourth and seven the Tilth and two the Tone, which is their
differcnoe. They are, however, unlike in this, that, while in
modern Music no interval differing very widely from the
twelllh part 01 00 Octave 00 some multiple thereos 10 used, in
ancient Greek Music, on the contrary, the existence 01 various
periods 01 Quarter· and Third-tonsa (equal to one-half and
two—thirds of the Semitone respectively) is well attested. For
11010 reason the Tone is perhaps a better unit 100 rough meas·
