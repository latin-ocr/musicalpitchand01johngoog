(3) that which is bocmdcd or awmnpacsed by two sounds
not of the same pitoh (Aristoxenus, Plutarch, Cleonides, Gau-
dentius, Bryennius); or a region or space (τόπος) receptive of
sonnds intermediate in pitoh to the bounding sounds (Aris-
toxenus, Bryennius) ; or a vocal magnitude defined or bounded
by two sounds (Bryennius).

(4) a passage (ὁδός or μετάβασις) from acute to grave or
croc varod or from one pitoh to another (Nicomachus, Cleonides,
Bryennius).

Dismissing definition (1) because it is too vagne, we may
notice that the definitione in gronp (2) merely express the fact
that it is a pitoh-difference on which the relationship depende,
but do not imply that there is sucha thing as difference in the
size of intervals and that measurement is possible. The differ-
ence of pitohes might be like a difference in color, or in odors
or tastes. In the definitione numbered (3) the idea of a space
' or distance is clearly brought out, and in (4) the notion of
movement from one bound to the other is included. Both (3)
and (4) imply more or less clearly the infinite subdivisibility
of pitoh. This is very plain in the definition that an interval
is a space receptiva of intermediate pitohes, for an intermedi-
ate pitoh would form two new smaller intervals, which would
themselves also be divisihle into yet smaller intervals Ι11(4), ·
and to a certain extent also in (3), κίνησις συνεχής seems to
lie at the bottom of the conception of sn interval. Without
this idea of agradual passage from one pitoh to another, it is
hard (ο see how change of pitoh could be regarded as a passage
at all. If the pitoh changes suddenly, in the way indicated
by κίνησις διαστηματική, the sensation does not suggest a
transition or transference so much as a transformation. The
effect is similar to that produced by a sudden change in color.
Intermediate shades of color are not present to the mind.

The continuous nature of pitoh would naturally be one of
the earliest points (ο be observed. But, although it would
readily be admitted that to all intents and purposes pitoh
seemed to be a continuous quantity and not a discrete qnan-
