the tensiones the parts of tho string is neoessarily the seme
as that of the whole string. The element of tensionis thus
eliminated.

Tho intervele to whioh attention would naturally first be
direeted in investigatione into the latios are the oonsonant
intervels. Tho terme oonsonant and dimonent refer, of oourse‚
to the character of the inter-vele in regard to the smoothness
or roughneoe of the oombination of sounds. By far tho greater
number of possible intervals ere dissonent. A small number
of oertain delinito sines or widths are eousouant In the matter
osaiae they seem to bear uo particular relation with one another
end with dissonent intervals. As we bewe seen,¹ they ere in-
oommonsurahle quantities. As to their eonsonanee, they vary
merkedly among themselves, and the smoothness of theseum
consonent interval will vary eooording to the absolute position
of the oomhination in the soale of eoutenm end gmveums and
aooording to the timbre of the notes. But at the senm time
eeoh oonsonent interval oen always be reoognirsd with amand
oerteinty, and, moreover, is tired in point of sine within nerrow
limite by reason ottho physioal oauses of the eonsouenoe. Suoh
intervals ere especially adopted to invoetigatious into the rela-
tions which exist between the vibrationnumbers, end between
the lengths of the vibreting stringe end of the solumne of air

producing the notoe.
