THE MEASUREMENT OF INTERVALS AMONG THE
ANCIENT GREEKS. â€™

THE material availablc for reconstructing the musicos
classical antiquity is unfortunately not very abundant. In
the case of the other fine arte, it is possible for the modern
world actually tc realize the art of the ancients through the
monuments of their activity which have survived tc our day.
This is preeminently the case with the three great space-arte,
sculpture, architectum, and painting. We are able to obtain
an immediate appreciation of these arts by actual contempla-
tion of sculptural, architectural, and pictorial remains, and the
extent of our appreciation will depend cn the degree to which,
from the nature of the material used, these remains have been
ableto withstand the destructive agenciee of time and the ele-
menta. In this way those arts in which stone was so generally
the material employed have sared better than those in which
a less durable medium was used. We may compare architec-
ture and sculpture with painting and the ceramic art in this
matter. But in all of them the appreciation is immediate 3
the contact between the ancient and the modern world is direct.
It is possible to study the actual creatione of ancient art, and
it is not necessary to rely wholly or even partly on indirect
means of approach, lihe theoretical treatises and chance allu-
sions in literature.
