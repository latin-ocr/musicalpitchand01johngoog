another is evidently at its maximum, except as it is lessened
by the restraining influence 01 accompanyiug instrumente.

This euables us 10 reduce the number 01 intervals which
had a distinct and separate existence by merging into one all
those intervals which are so nearly of a size that we are
justified in regarding thern aa different aspects cf the same
phenomenon. But after we have carried this process as far as
it is reasonable 10 do so, the number of intervals 1011 10 01111
very great—far greater than we admit in modern theory.
Many of them are irreconcilably different in width. These
intervals, it would seem, must be accepted as havingan inde-
pendent existence aud as being necessary 10 the formation 01
the scales of Greek music. But it is not necessary to assume
that they all existed in actual musio at the same time. There
is still another possible cause for the differeuoes in the sine 01
intervals which must be considered in any attempt 10 appre-
01010 the scales 01 Greek musio, and with it we bring our
discussion 10 0 conclusion.

It is the liability to which dissonant intervals in particular,
if not alone, are subject of undergoing a gradual change in
their 0100 with the development of the scale 01 which they are
a part. It must be borne in mind that homophonio or pure
melodia music¹ does 001 demand a strict adherence 10 definite
degrees of pitch in the formationes its scales, and variation
in the width 01 the intervals is necessarily a result 01 this
freedom. In considering variations due to the tuniug we
assumed au ideal intonation for the interval which the best
authorities would recognize as a just intonation. In the case
01 the variations now under consideration there is 00 criterion .
by which it is possible to select one width in preference to
another as a more perfect representative 01 the interval.
Fixed degrees of pitch come in with simultaneous harmony,
of which we know that Greek music made little use. When
