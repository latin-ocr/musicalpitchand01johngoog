in the Aristoxenean treatment of pitch changes,¹ thie form of
mowement (which may be described as a continuone movement
modified by the periods of rest characteristic of discrete move·
ment) was not overlooked, but was noticed only to be passed
over.

Aristoxenus, Ham, 1. ξ 27, p. 9 Meib. : ληπτέον δὲ ἑκάτε-
ρον τούτων (the two forme of motion) κατὰ τὴν αἰσθήσεως
φαντασίαν. πότερον μὲν «γὰρ δύνατον ἢ ἀδύνατον φωνὴν
κινεῖσθαι καὶ (ἢ Meib.) πάλιν ἵστασθαι αὐτὴν ἐπὶ μιᾶς
τάσεως, ἑτέρας ἐστὶ σκέψεως, καὶ πρὸς τὴν ἐνεστῶσαν
πραγματείαν οὐκ ἀναγκαῖον, τὸ διακονῆσαι (δὲ κινῆσαι libb.)
τούτων ἑκάτερον. ὁποτέρως γὰρ ἔχει τὸ αὐτὸ ποιεῖ πρός γε

κινήσεων.

But it is not easy to see why continuone motion ae a whole
should not be omitted, if that modification of it which admits
pericde of rest at fixed pitehes ie rejected, inaemuch ae the
latter ie far more musical in ite nature than the former.
Withont eteadiness in the pitch it would be almost impossible
to gain an idea of musical interval, and all musicis based on
interval, or the relation which subsiste between musical notes.
Mr. Hubert Parry εαγεε2 “Just ae among the early auoestore
of our species, speech would begin when the indefinite noises
which they first used to communicate with one another, like
animale, passed into some definite eound which conveyed to
the savage ear some definite and constant meaning; eo the
indefinite eries and shoute which expreeeed their feelings
began to pase into music when a few definite notes were made
to take the place of vague irregular shcuting.'' And again,
a little further on: “ So the resouroes of music increased ae
the relations cf more and more definite notes were established,
in obedienoe to the development of musical instinct, and as
