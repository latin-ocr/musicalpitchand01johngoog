not a bad substitute for the spoken word. But in the case oi
music there ie no clement which we can seperate, or imagine
to be separated, from the sounds themselves, without destroy-
ing the very nature of the music. While rhythm is, perhaps,
aster the sounds, i. a, the pitch clement in sounds, the most
important constituent, rhythm alone is not music.

In what condition, then, is the study of ancient classical
music with regard to our ability to reproduce the actual
sounds‘l What are the steps which we must take in order
to obtain a correct interpretation of the music of the Greeks?

From one point of view musical sounda may be regarded
aa endowed with two dimensione. One of these is pitoh; the
other is time. Every sound in a melody differs from every
other sound, either in one of these dimensione or in both3
and every sound is defined, or at least is defined in every
particular essential to constituting the melody, by giving tha
pitch of each note and its time-clement in the two respects of
the position in time and the duration in time. The time·
codrdiuates and the pitch-cobrdinates together constitute the
melody. As a result, melody can be represented graphically
on a plane, and this is what is done in a rough wey by the
ordinary staff notation by means of the position of the notes
ou the staff (modified by the hey-signatura and the ‘acci-
dental' sharps and flate), and by their position chag the staff
(aa determined hythe bars and modified by differences in
their appearance to give their duration).

There ere, to be sure, other ways in which musical notes
may differ from one another. In addition to differences of
pitch and of duration, we may have differeuces of ‘timbre'

or ‘quality,' and differenoes in the loudness or ‘force' with '

which the notes are soundod. But the quality and the force
may be varied without destroying the nature of a melody,

whereas alterations in the pitches of the notes which forma ¹

tuoe, and in their duration·values, cannot, in general, be made
without altering the melody. It is only when the changes of
pitch or of duration are uniform throughout a piace of music
