intervals now ealled imperfect oonsonanoes, although used in
anoient musio not only in melody (note after note), but also in
aooompaniment or harmony (note against note), were neverthe·
less olassed aa dissonant. ,

But there are three intervals wbioh are oonsonant to so
marked adegree that they are olassed as oonsonant in every
musioal system. They ars the Oetave‚ the Fisth, and the
Fourth. Inasmuoh as all the other intervals whioh the Greek
treatises recognize as oonsouant may be derived from thess
three primary oonsonauoes, and oonsist of two or more of
them added together,¹ it will be suffioient if we show that the
ratios belonging to these three intervals were disoovered by
the ancients, and that this important method of measuring
inter-vals was snooessfully employed by them. We shall then
have au absolutely trustworthy means of identifying anoient
intervals with their modern representativss.

Pythagoras, honored by the Greeks as the disooverer of the
musioal retios, determined the ratio for the Ootsve (διὰ πασῶν)
to be 1 : 2, the ratio sor the Fisth (διὰ πέντε or δι’ ὀξενῶν) to bs

223, and the ratio for the Fourth (διὰ τεσσάρων) to be 324 3 that
isto say,a string whose length is double that of another sounds
anots an Ootsve lower, and similarly with the other intervals.
These ratius were undoubtedly obtained by direot observation.
We may suppose the philosopher to have used either a single
string, furnished with a finger-board, or two stringe tuned in'

unison, or a string fumished witha movable bridge aa de-
soribed above (p. 43), the monochord. The lyre is not adopted
to such experimenta, but the Egyptians had instruments with
very long stringe stretohed over a finger-board, and Pytha·
goras may easily have been aoquainted withthese The ratios .

¹It is true that the Octava is equod to the snm oi the sisu and Fourth,
and all the Greek oonsonanoes may thus be said to be oomposed oi Fifths ’
and Fourths3 but it is better ior a number ol reasons to regard the Fiith
and the Fourth as parts oi the Octavo, the result of the first division thereos,
than to regard the latter as the result oi oomponnding the former.
