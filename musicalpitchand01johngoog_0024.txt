idid„ 11 (p. 7 Κ. v. Jan)z ὥστε ἡ πληγὴ τοῦ ἀνοπνεορένον
ἅέρος ὑπὸ τῆς ἐν τούτοις τοῖς μορίοις ψυχῆς πρὸς τὴν κολου-
μένην ἀρτηρίαν φωνή ἐστιν· οὐ ’γὰρ πᾶς ζῴον ψόφος φωνή,
καθάπερ εἴπομεν (ἔστι γὰρ καὶ τῇ γλώττῃ ψοφεῖν καὶ ὡς οἱ
βήττοντες), ἀλλὰ δεῖ ἔμψυχόν τε εἶναι καὶ μετὰ φοντοσίος
τινός· σημοντιιιὸς ’γὰρ δή τις ψόφος ἐστὶν ἡ φωνὴ καὶ οὔ τοῦ
ἀνοπνεομένον ἀέρος ὥσπερ ὁ βήξ.

It appears, then, that whereas φωνή is used properly of the
voioe only, the term was applied also to the tenes of musieal ’
instrumente. Aristoxenus speaks of φωνὴ ὀργανική τεκαὶ
ιἰνθρωτική (Herm, p. 14 Mein).

The analysis of articulate sound into its phonelio elements
is important to the art of writing‚ and oonsequently the
various vowel-sounds and eonsenant-sounds must have been
differentiated from very early times, sinoe it was this that
led to the invention of waiting by letters to take the plaoe of
ideographio waiting.

Another important principle of division is involved in the
distinction between musioal and unmusioal sounds. This

’ olassifieation oonoerns chiefly the Solense of Musio. As Pho·
netios disregards all but articulate sounds, so the Selenes of
Musio deals only with musical sounds. It should be observed

that the line which separates musical sounds frorn unmusioal
sounds erosses that whioh separatas articulate and inarticulata
sounds. An articulate sound may be either musieal or un·
musioa13 so may an inarticulate sound.

What, then, is meant by musical and unmusieal or non·
musical? In the first plane, the term ‘musieal,' as used in
this eonneotion, does not, of oourse, mean merely ‘ used in
musio! In that ease it would only be necessary to enumerate
the kinds of sounds so used. On the contrary, many sounds
whioh must be elassed with musical sounds are unsuitable for
use in musio on aeoount of difficulties attending their pro-
duction or for some other reason ; and many unmusieal sounds
are used in musio to produoe eertum effeots‚ generally of a
rhythmioal nature. Nevertheless‚ it is true in a general way
