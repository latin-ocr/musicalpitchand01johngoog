their period. Inasmuch as, if we omit from consideration the
clement of duration in time, sounds differ from one another
in three most prominent particulare,l their loudness (force,
intensity), their timbre (quality, Kana-Forte), and their pitch,
any one of these qualities or properties may be described as
that particular in which asound varies, if the other two are
kept constant. If, then, the notes of one and the same instru-
ment are sounded with the same degree of loudness, the notes
will differ only in their pitch. Although Helmholtz's dis-
covery that ordinary musical notes are oomposed of a number
of related pitches, of which one is predomineut, is now uni-
versally accepted, and although timbre is thus reduced toa
matter of pitchos, the threefold division of the characteres
musical sounds is still useful. By the pitch of a note, then,
the predominant pitch is generally meant, and since there is
uo indication that timbre was analyzed in this way by any of
the ancients, we shall not have to do with any but this, the
nominal pitch of a musical sound.

But it is by no means certain that the existence of the vibra-
tione by which sound is produced was unknown to the Greeks.
The passage from the Aristotelian de audibilibus, quoted at
p. 7, seems to show that the nature of the motion ol the air
was suspected, if not proved. still more suggestive are the
last words of the following passage:

Aristotle, de unima,118,7 (p 5 K. v. Jau)= ἔστι *γὰρ ὁ
ψόφος κίνησις τοῦ δυναμένου κινεῖσθαι τὸν τρόπον τοῦτον
όνπερ τά ἀφαλλόρενα ἀπὸ τῶν λείων, όταν τις spodon. οὐ
δὴ πᾶν ὥσπερ εἴρηται ψοφεῖ τυπτόμενον καὶ τύπτον, οἷον
ε’ἀν πατάξῃ βελόνη βελόνην· ἀλλά δεῖτὸ τυπτόμενον ὁμαλὸν
εἶναι, ὥστε τὸν ἀέρα ἀθροῦν ἀφάλλεσθαι καὶ σείεσθαι. v

Furthermore we have Aristotle, Problcma, x1x. 392 ἡ dev·

different qualities, so far as their effect on the ear is oonosmed, via, loud-
asse, piat, and umore’'
