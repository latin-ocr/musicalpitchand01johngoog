55Ι

After eommenting on the wonderful properties of the
Pythagoream tetrastys, the number 36,1 the author olaims for
the quaternion in question, ealled the Platonio tetraotys‚ an
even higher degree of perfeetion. The planen which the
quaternionis construoted isthen set forth and the advantage
of the Lambda-like arrangement is seon to be that like
powers of 2 and 3 are eonveniently placed for being added
and multiplied together. In chapter 12 they are added:
2†3=5; 4†a=13; 8†27=35; and thesignifieanoe
of these numbers is stated in the following words (Plus, de
αιιίιιι. prodr„ e. 12, 1017 F): τούτων γὰρ τῶν ἀριθμῶν οἱ
Πυθαγορικοὶ τὰ μὲν ε’ τροφόν, ὅπερ ἐστὶ φθόγγον, ἐκάλουν,
οἰόμενοι τῶν τοῦ τόνου διαστημάτων πρῶτον εἶναι φθεγκτὸν
τὸ πέμπτου· τὰ δὲ τρισκαίδεκα λεῖμμα, καθάπερ Πλάτων,
τὴν εἰς ἴσα τοῦ τόνου διανομὴν ἀπογιγνώσκοντες· τά δὲ πέντε
καὶ τριάκοντα ἁρμονίαν, ὅτι συνέστηκεν ἐκ δυεῖν κύβων
πρώτων ἀπ’ ἀρτίου καὶ περιττοῦ γεγονότων, ἐκ τεσσάρων δ’
ἀριθμῶν, τοῦ ς’ καὶ τοῦ η’ καὶ τοῦ θ’ καί ιβ ’, τὴν ἀριθμητικὴν
καὶ τὴν ἁρμονικὴν ἀναλογίαν περιεχόντων.

Nothing more is said at this plaoe of 5, the τροφόν, and 13,
the λεῖμμα,2 but the nature of the ἁρμονία, 35, is illustrated
by means of a diagram. A reetangle is oonstruoted whose
sides are to one another in length as 5 to 7. The area will
then be 35. The author then divides the reetengle into four
oompartments by. drawing two lineo, one perpendicular to the
shorter sides and dividing them eaoh into two parts with
lengths 2 and 3, and the other perpendicnlar to the longer
sides and dividing them into parts with lengths 3 and 4.

1'l'he sum oi the first four even numbers and the first four odd numbers
isse: 1÷3÷5÷7=16
2÷4†6†8=2o .

Every odd number with the following even number forms a syzygy. The
fourth symgy, 7 and 8, is the first to form aequare (ἀπ-36), whether
alone or, as in the present case, added to the sum of its predecessore.

'The τροφόν will be discussed at p. 62, εγ, the λεῖμμα at p. 57, sq.
