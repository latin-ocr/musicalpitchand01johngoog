’ two notes are sounded together it is instinctive tc avoid as
much as possible the roughness produced by rapid bcats
between nearly coincident partiale and combinational tones‚¹
and this results in a tendeucy to make the intervals true—
1. a, true tc those vibration-numbers which will give the
lewest beate or none at all-and so to fix the width of the
intervals according to the simplet ratius, because they give
the best results. Every note in our modern scale has had its
just intonation (not, of course, its tempered intonaticn) flxed
by these very considerations‚² for every one of them is used
on occasion as partos a chord. Now in Greek music the
designation ‘consonant interval' was limited to the Octave,
Fisth, and Fourth, and those intervals which are equal to
one of these plus one or more Octsves (cf. p. 45). Music was
not ready to take the step by which Thirds and Sixths were
recognized as consonant. As a result, all dissonant intervals,
except possibly those which are derived from the consonances
by subtraction, such as the Major-tone and the Leimma (cf.

p. 57), were free from any such influenoe (and it isa powerful
influence) tending to fix their sine permanently. The conso-
nant intervals may have been tuned (the probabilities are

strong that they were always tuned) by sounding the notes
simultaneously, but it is not likely that the Greek dissonances
could have gained anything in exactness of tuning fronr
sounding the notes together.⁸ It would accordingly not be
