of other intervals, consonant and dissonant, may have been
obtained either directly from the string or indirectly by com·
bining the relios already found. Thus the consonent intervals,
the Twelfth (Octava -Ι- sien) end the Double-octeve, were
probably found to depend on the ratios 1 :3 end 124, respect·
ively. The Tune, which is the difference in width between
the Fisth end the Fourth‚ was certainly regarded es dependent
on the ratio 829, but it is probable that this ratio was osten
deduced from the retios already obtained, and was not directly
observed from the lengths of string.

This fect, that the Tone is the differenoe of the two impor-
tant consonances‚ the Fifth end tho Fourth‚ has given this
dissonant interval a prominent place in musical theory. In
consequence of being defined in this manner (as the difference
of two consonant intervals), the Tone may be tuned with the
same degree of precision that is obtainable in the cese of the
consonent intervals. Dissonant intervals in general cannot
be tuned with any great accuracy. The Tone is thus closely
related to the consonanoes. Another fact has aided in giving
the 'Pone en importance not rightfully belonging to it. It is
that it differs from the sixth part of the Octavo by only a
minute interval. The ratio 829 taken six times (= 262‚144:

531,441) differs from the ratio 122 (=262‚1442524‚288) by ’

every small ratio. The corresponding small interval, called
the Pythagorean Comma, is only a little lerger than the ordi-
nary Comma (802 81), en interval which is neglected in the
tuning of modern keyed instrumente. For these two reasons
the Tone seemed to be well adapted for use as a unit of
measurement‚ end to have an especial quality. We are not,
. therefore, surprised to find that the Tone is of frequent occur-
rence in scales, as it is the only difference between intervals
which were recognized as consonant, which was not itself also
consonant. Its appearance in theoreticel scales is natural ; the
facility with which it may be tuned would undoubtedly cause
it also to appear in scales as actually tuned—for example, on
the lyre. But, if it is permittedtodraw conclusione by analogy
