be the τροφόν, and that the Pythagoreens hit on this as an
explanation sor the number 5 from the following considera-
tions. The interval is so small that the difference in the two
pitohes is but little, if any, wider than those differences in·
pitch which make a note out of tune to the average ear.
That is, it is about the smallest interval which differs suffi-
eiently from unison to be entitled to the designation ‘musical
interval! We feel a natural reluctance to calling minute
pitch-differenees by the same name as those evident altera-
tions of pitoh on which music is based. In considering the
effect of cutting off the small divisione one aiter the other
experimenters may easily have come to the conclusion that
the first of the 256 parts (apparently called ‘ intervals of the
tone,' but for what reason we can only surmise, for the phrase
does not occur elsewhereasfar asIam aware) makes no interval
‘which can be sounded' (φθεγκτὸν), nor does the second, nor
the third, nor the fourth, but the fisth gives a note which can
be regarded as forming a distinct interval with the open
string. The passage will then run: “The Pythagoreans
called five τροφόν [‘food' apparently 1]—that is a (musical)

(ll = {l Χ ffl), it is probable that about 15 of the 256 parts would be
taken (16 would be the exact number to take) ior sounding the Semitons‚
instead ot the 13 required for the Leimma3 consequently a third of them
would fall very near to the 5 which form the desired interval.

1Inthe above I have regarded τροφόν as the accusative of the neuter
form rb τροφόν, meaning ‘sood, nourishment' which occurs in Plato, Pota,
289 A. It has been suggested to me that we may have here the accusative
of the commoner masculine and feminine τροφός ‘seeden nourisher, nurse,'
that the number 5 is personified after a fashion characteristic of the Pytha·
goreans. For example 7 was called Ἀθηνᾶ and παρθένος, because alone
among the numbers which oompose the decade, 7 neither generatos noris
generated, that is, it is neither a factor nor a multiple os any other number

· lnthe decade (ef. Theon. Smyrn, demas, c. 46, p. 103 Hiller). Somewhat

similarlyd was sometimes called γάμος besam it can be regarded as the
union or marriage of the first odd number, 3, which is male, with the first
even number, 2, whioh is female (1 is a number spart). The thought
would then seem to bc that 5 plays ths role of a nurse in bringing out the
first sound which is φθεγκτόν.
