tioeof certain writers of assigning the greater number in a ratio
tothehighernote K. von Jan distinctly claime a knowledge
of the vibratione of the air for the ancients.l

The Greek words for pitch, τόσις and τόνος, are of course
connected with the idea of stretching. It would be observed
from stringed instrumente that increase in the tension pro-
duoed a heightening of the piteh (ἐπίτασις), and that relaxa·
tion produced a lowering (ἄνεσις). Height of piteh or high
pitch is expressed by ὀξύτης, the reverse by βαρύτηςς ὀξύς
and βαρύς are the words for acute and grave.

A rigorous definition of piteh does not seem to have been
attempted in the ancient works on musical science. It was
usual to detine the term either by means of ὀξύτης and βαρύ.
της, or by means of ἐπίτασις and ἄνεσις. In the former
method the idea of height and depth in pitch was assumed
and pitch itself was defined as that which is common to these.
This is the course puisued by Claudius Ptolemy, the Alexan-
drian mathematiciau, astronomer, and geographer.

Ptolemy, Harmonice, 1. iv„ p. 8Wallis: ὀ γὰρ οὕτω λεηό-
μενος τόνος κοινὸν ἂν εἴη «γένος τῆς ὀξύτητος καὶ τῆς βαρύτη-
τος, παρ’ ἓν εἶδος τὸ τῆς τάσεως εἰλημμένος, ὡς τὸ πέρας τοῦ
τέλους καὶ τῆς ἀρχῆς. As ‘limit' covers both ‘end’ and
‘beginning' so τόνος both ὀξύτης and βαρύτης.2

In the other method of defining piteh, the changes in
pitch observed in the tenes of the humen voice and in those
of musical instrumente produced the concept of an upward
and downward motion, and pitch was defined as the absence
of such motion, that is,asstanding or rest. This is the method

employed by Aristoxenus. Τιίσις is defined as μονή τις καὶ
στόσις τῆς φωνῆς (Heremias, 1. ἓ 31, p. 12 Meib.)‚ or aa
ἠρεμία φωνῆς (Ibid. 1. ἓ 32, p. 13 Meib.: ἡ δὲ τάσις ὅτι μὲν
οὔτ’ ἐπίτασις οὔτ’ ι’ίνεσίς ἐστι παντελῶς δῆλον,-τὴν μὲν γὰρ

'Compare Porphyry, commodatius, p. matvallis: ἔστιγὰρ καὶ ἡ βαρύτης
πόσις καὶ ἡ ὀξύτης τίσις.
