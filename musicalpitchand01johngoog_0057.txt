exercised. For in order that two stringe oi equal length and
size shall produce sounds which form some given interval, it
is necessary to use weights which are to each other inversely
as the apaturos of the lengths of strings of equal siae at the
same tension producing the same interval ; in other words,
the lengths vary inversely as the square-roots of the weights.
The weights would not, therefore, give directly the ratios
desired. It is doubtful if the ancients could have obtained the
musical ratios from weights attached to stringe. Allowanee
would also have to be made for the fact that the weight of
the string per linear unit is diminished by the tension.
Ptolemy appreciated the difficulties attending these methcds
and discusses thern in his Harmoniae, 1. viii, p. 17 Wallis
The instrument on which the greatest reliance was placed
for determining the ratios was the κανὼν μονόχορδος or ἁρμο-
νικός. Ptolemy describes it in the chapter cited above. It
consisted of a vibrating string stretehed between two fixed
bridges, and passing overa third bridge, which could move
freely between the fixed bridges, and thus could be used to
divide the whole length of the string into two parts at any
desired point. The distance between the movable bridge and
the fixed bridges was measured on a scale which ran beneath
the string. By means of this instrument the ratios associated
with the various musical intervals could easily be calculated.
Conversely‚ if the movable bridge were placed at such a point
that the distance from one fixed bridge bore a certain ratio to
the length of the whole string, the interval corresponding ,to
the ratio could be produced. If the whole length of the string
were tuned to be in unison with the lowest note of the scale of
two Octaves, called the Perfect System, the proper distanoes
could be marked off for all the other notes. This operation
was called ἡ τοῦ κανόνος κατατομή. We have a description
of the method in which the string was divided tc produce this
scale in Theo Smyrnaeus, de musico, c. 12 (pp. 57, 58 Hiller),
and cc. 35, 36 (pp. 87-93 Hiller), where Thrasyllus is quoted
in astaram and in Euclid, sectio cononis, ἐξ 19, 20 (p. 163, sq.
