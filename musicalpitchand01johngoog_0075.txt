the experiment of some ancient investigator. Let the sound
produced by the whole length of a string be the lowest of two
notes forming a Fourth. The upper note will then be given
by three-quartem of the string. In order to descend by Major-
tones from this upper note, it is necessary twice in succession
to increase the length of the vibrating part of the string by
an eighth part of itself. The ff of the string must, then, be
multiplied by ff to give the length which will sound the second
(descending) note, and the result by t again to give the third.
We shall have ξ>< ff >< ξε m for the length used for this
third (next to the gravest) note. Therelore, if the whole
string is divided into 256 equal parts, when the string is
‘stupped' by the finger so as to cut off 13 parts (leaving 243
to vibrate), it will give a note forming with the open string
the interval of the Leimma. The next 27 parts (making 40)
will gives note acuter than the last by the interval of a Tone,
and the next 24 (making 64 in all) will give another Tone,
completing the whole Fourth. In this way the Pythagorean
numerical values for the Tone and Leimma may he practically
illustrated. .

We have now seen how the Pythagoreans put a musical
interpretation on the sum of the equares of 2 and 3 and on
the sum of their umes, the numbers of the double quaternion
having been arranged in the convenient form of a Lambda,
which suggested the idea of adding like powers. On the
one hand, they took the result ol the addition (the number
35, the sum of the cubes), made a new separation of the
material, and obtained, as the result of the analysis, four
numbers (6, 8, 9, and 12), such that they can represent the
four most important notes of the octachord of Pythagoras
(hypate, mese, paramese, and nete ¹), whether they are regarded

1They are the ‘standing' notes (see p. 60, η’, above). In the (Greater)
Periect System (which is the original octachord expanded at each end) their
names are: ὑπάτη μισῶν, μέση, παραμέση, and νήτη διεζευγμένων (νήσων).
