ae proportional to the lengthe cf the vibrating stringe or, in
modern manner, to the vibratos-numbers of the notes.1 On
the other hund, they connected the result (13, the sum of the
equares) with a particular ratio, which they used to express a
certain interval ooourring in their scales. The ¹fact that the
numbers concerned in these operatione can be dealt with in
this way is the merset coincidence. It is nothing more than
an arithmeticel accident (to call it such) that the eum of the
equares should equal the difference between 256 and 243, or
that the eum oi the cubes should also be the sum oi 6, 8, 9,
and 12, numbers in which an arithmetical and an harmonical
progression can be found. But such ie the state of affaire.

It remains that we should consider the sum of the first
powers, the number ὃ, which the Pythagoream called τροφόν,
according to the passage from Plutarch quoted on p. δῦ. So
far as Iam eware, no explanation has ever been given for
thie number, beyond what is contained in Plutarch’e words.
They are (densim.proor.,o.12, 1017 F): oi Πυθαγορικοὶ

The following seeum to me to be the solution of the problem.
Using the same apparatus as we hed in the experiment just
described, it we measure offo of the 256 equal parts and stop
the string at thet point, we obtain a small interval about
