This arithmetical difference varies with the sizo of the terms
which compose the ratio, whereas the sine of thanatio is inde-
pendent of the siae of the terms used in forming it. For
example, the Fifth is expressed by any of the following sotios,
223, 629, 1002150, bnt the differenceis now 1, now 3, now
50. But there is this to be said, that whereas the ratios of
most of the intervals oocurring in music are reducible to ratios
whose arithmetical difference is 1, or occasionally 2, the ratio
of the Leimma cannot be reduced to any lower terms than
2432256, and the difference will therefore always be either
13 or a multiple of 13.

To show how 27 could be regarded as representing the sine
of the Tene, we must turn again to the scales in the Timaeus
construeted on the double geometrical quaternion. When the
duple and triple intervals which characterizet the two branches
arefilled up with arithmetical and harmonieal means, the
series obtained involve fractional numbers (see the series given
on p. 48), and when every epitrito ratio (3 : 4) is filled np with
epogdoa (8 29), as far as possible, leaving Leimmata, the new
terms to be inserted necessitate the use of inconveniently large
numbers in expressing the improper fractione which result.
Το avoid these fractione, we may follow the example of the
ancient commentatore, and multiply all the terms of the series
by the same number, so as to obtain whole numbers alone in
which to express the ratios. The first four terms of the binary
branoh, 1, t, ἃ, 2, become 6, 8, 9, 12, when multiplied hythe
least common multiple of the denominators of the fractione.
If now we take the first interval in the series, the ratio 324,
and proceed to insert two intervals of 8 29, we must multiply
the terme of the ratio by' 8². This gives 3 >< 8² :4 >< 8²=
192 z 256, and we have the following series after inserting the
epogdoa: 192 (Tone) 216 (Tene) 243 (Ioimma) 256 3 and if we
take the arithmetical differences, we obtain:
for the Leimma, 256-243=13,
and for the two Tonas, 243-216=27,
and 216-192224.
