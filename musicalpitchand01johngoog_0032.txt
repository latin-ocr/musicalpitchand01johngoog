If now we consider the flow of sonnd proceeding from any
instrument and regard only the manner in which change of
pitoh takes place, it is plain that the former of the two manners
mentioned above (sudden changes) implies for practical pur-
poses restat various stages, that is to say, there will bea
period of fixed pitoh before and after each leap.¹ The second
manner (gradual changes) implies nothing as to periods of
fixed or stationary pitch. The glides may connect what are
called notes or musical sounds,² or there may be no such notes,
the pitoh may never become fixed, but may wonder up and
down at random. But when the pitoh does remain fixed
before and after a glide, we have the phenomenon of porta-
mento (see above, p. 12), in which the two manners combine.

Returning to Aristoxenus, we find that κίνησις φωνῆς
(briefly, change of pitoh) is divided into two kinds oi move-
ment, κίνησις συνεχής and κίνησις διασινιματιιιή.3 Of these
the former, οοιιιίιιιιοιιο movement, is that in which coi only
are the changes in pitoh oontinuous, bai there are no periods
of lixed pitoh. The latter, ἀιίονοίι movement (intervallate) is
that in which the pitch leaps over intervals and then resta at
various degrees of pitoh.

The passage in which this subjectis dealt with runs as
follows:

Aristoxenus, Horra, 1. i 26, p. 8 Meib.: κατὰ μὲν οὖν τὴν

συνεχῆ, τόπον τινὰ διεξιέναι φαίνεται ἡ φωνὴ τῇ αἰσθήσει,
οὕτως ὥς δν μηδαμοῦ ἱσταμένη < ᾖ >, μηδ’ ἐτ’ αὐτῶν τῶν
περάτων, carri we τὴν τῆς αἰσθήσεως φαντασίαν, ἀλλὰ depo-

μένη συνεχῶς μέχρι σιωπῆς. κατὰ δὲ τὴν ἑτέραν, ἣν ὀνομάζο-
μεν διαστηματιιιήν, ἐναντίως φαίνεται κινεῖσθαι· διαβαίνουσα

¹We can, oi course, conceive oi a glide taking place Immediately aiter a
step, but such a periermance may eaisiy be omitted from consideration.

κινεῖσθαι riv εἰρημένον αὑτὸν τρίτον, δίο ruis elau ἰδέαι κυήσεως, ἦ τε συνεχὴς
ui i διασημᾶναι
