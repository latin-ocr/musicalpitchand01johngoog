tinuous sonnds are those in which the regions (τόποι) of the
changes (in pitch) in each direction are noh manifest, or in
which no part whatever ie ἰσότονος fora perceptible interval
(of time). The same sort of thing is seen in the ease of the
colors of the rainbow. of such a nature are those sounds
which sonnd at the saum lime as their pitch is being raised or
lowered, even while thie change is being produced.'' The
lowing of cattle and the howling of wolves are given as
examples of these continuone sounds. Porphyry¹¹ adds the
attempta of the beginner at singing‚ who cannot sicilie the
right pitch at first, but feels for il.² He also gives as an
instance the tuning of stringed instrumente. All such ‘con-
tinuone' sounds are uniit for music.

Ptolemy’s second class, ‘discrete’ sounds-drc'doc (ἀνισό-
τονοι) διωρισμένοι-ᾖε defines as sounds “ in which the
regions of the changes (in pitoh) are manifest.'' The spaces
or pitch-distanoes traversed ane measurable, or such sounds
arise when their parts remain ‘eqnitcnio' for a perceptible
interval of time. As a parallel he gives the juxtaposition of
pure and unmixed colors. Sonnds like these are suitable for
musio, because they are bounded by ἰσότονοι ψόφοι and may
be measured by their exoesses (ὑπεροχαῦ, that is, by their
ratios.

Continuous sounde are, then, sounds in which the variation
in pitch takes place in euch a way that it advanoes by insen-
sible gradatione and that it has no defined limite. Discrehe ,
sounds are those in which the pitch moves over well-defined
distances. The two classes ane characterized precisely by the
two kinds of κίνησις explained by Aristoxenus-the coutinu-
