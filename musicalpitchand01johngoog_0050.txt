ἐμμελῆ)ι is very small oompared with the number of inter·

vals possible,¹ it does not seem uureasonable to hope that one
or other of them, or some aliquot part, may serve our purpose.

Suppose, now, that we represent pitoh hya straight line,
and that equal distanoes on the line stand for equal intervals,
wherever taken· If then we arbitrarily ohoose a oertain
length on thelina to represent any given interval, suoh as the
Ootave,³ it will, of oourse, be possible to find distanoes whieh
will aoourately represent all other intervals. The sum of two
sneh distanoes will then represent the snm of the two eorre-
sponding intervallo, obtained by making the acute note of one
of them eoinoide with the grave note of the other. In like
manner the arithmetioal differenoe of any two distanoes will
represent the differenoe of the oorresponding intervals‚ obtained
by making the two acute notes or the two grave notes ooinoide.

¹Compare Sedley Taylor, siqu Staytoy, 11 11, 12, where it is stated that
within the eompass of an average voice, two or three hundred different
degressos piteh are distinguiahable. If the eompass of such a voioe is taken
to be an octava and a fifth (op. ott 1 74), only twenty of these different pitehes
are found on our keyed instrumenta, where temperament prevails. This
number is considerably increased in practice, when temperament is ignored,
asin ainging and violin music, but even then the number oi notes to the
octavo is eomparatively small. It must be remembered that in those oom-
putations in which it is found that a perfect keyed instrument would have
to have twenty-five or more keys within eaoh oetave, many of these notes
are incompatible (so to speak) with ons another (ἐκμελεῖς). Belonging to
remotely related keys, they do not occur in one and the same pieoe of musio,
andare often so close aa to be almost indistingnishable in pitoh. Itis
equally true of Greek music, that, althougha large number of notes within
each ootare was recognized, they were not all oi them unable in the same
piace of musio Aristoxenus (Hatra, p. 28 Meib.) is our authority ior tho
statement that the voiee eannot advame by quarter-tones beyond the seoond
step. The number of notes used at one time was never many more than
eight within the octave.

⁸Following the example of Mr. A. J. Ellis in his translation of Helm·
holta’s &meum os Torta, tud Eng. ed, 1885, the names of immola will
hersalter be written with capital initial letters, as Filth, Major-third,
Semitone.
