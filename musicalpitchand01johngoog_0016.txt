How different is the state of affairs in the uase of the
time-arte, poetry and musio! Although it is sels-evident, it is
interesting to refleet that these arts, based as they are ona
madium so immaterial as sound, demand a fresh representa·
tion whenever it is desired actually to experienee any of their
productions3 and this is true no less of poetry thanes musio,
although oertain qualilioations must be added in the ease of
the former. For when we read to ourselves, the reproduetion
of the sounds is, of oourse, imagined, and reading musio differs
from reading languago only in that it is an art more diffioult
to anquira, and that less satisfactory results are obtained in
the silent reading of musio than in that of written words. It
follows that the folleat appreciation of these time-urta ean he
gained only when we are ableto reproduoe the aotual sounds
with at least approximate aoouraoy.

But poetry stands on an entirely different plane from musio
for an evident reason. Itis that poetry does not eonsist of
words alone, however melodious and rhythmieal‚ but the
thought is an assential element in its oomposition ; and if it
is objeoted that this is true of musio also, it is true iu quite a
different sense. Musioal sounds are not, individually, like
works, the symbols of thoughts, hut the thought in musio
arises from the oombination and union of sounds, but is aot
the sounds, while in language the thought of a sentenoe springs
lrorn the oombination of lesser thoughts, of whioh the words
are only the symbols, and sor whieh any other symbols, like
signs with the fingere, oould serve almost as well.

For these reasons poetry is in a far better position than
musio for perpetuating its productione. To take the ease of
Greek poetry, wa are able to lay down with no little eonii.
denoe rules for the eorreot pronunciation of the words, and
for theoorreot scansion of the metres. But even if hy some
means not now available we should learn that all our suppo·
sitione on these pointe were utterly wrong, we should still
possess the thought, and the thought is imperishahle so long as
a knowledge of the language existe. The written word is
