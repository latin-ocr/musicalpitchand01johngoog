In the last division (that in which sounds of constant pitch
were separated from sounds of varying pitch) the principle
employed was the behavior of pitch from moment to moment,
its changeability or constancy. We are now led to suggest
another principle which might be used to subdivide onoe
again those sounds which are characterized by the presence of
pitch. It is the complexity or simplicity of the arrangement
¹ of the various heights or degressos pitch which are present
at any and every point of time in every sound except the
theoretieally pure tone of scienee If the constituent pitches
are arranged with reference to some principle of order, so
that the pitches are related, the sound will be musical, and on
this order will depend the quality or timbre of the note. On
the other hand, if the arrangement is disorderly‚ the sound
ι will be unmusioal or noisy. As we have noticed before,a
bell may have been so unsucoessfully cast that, apert from
the variation so noticeable from timeto time, the different
parts give forth sounds of different and unrelated pitches.
The result is a noise. If all the keys of a piano which
one can oover with the hand are sounded at once, a noise
is produced.

Applying this principle of order in the constituent pitches
to the class of sounds whose pitch is constant, we obtain two
sections, into one of which all sounds which it seems inappre-
priate to call ‘musical’ will be collected. Similarly, in the
coordinate'eless of sounds whose pitch varice, one scotion will
comprise those sounds which are musical in every particular
except the variation in pitch (e. 9., the glide of the portamento,
the sound ofa boatman's siren), the other will include sounds
which are noisy both from the quality of the tone and from
the variation in the pitch (e. 9., the creahing of a hinge).

If we use this principle of order in a slightly different
manner, we may subdivide varying sounds according as the
variation is orderly and limited by fixed bounds (e. 9., porta-

mento)‚ or is not. When orderly, the variatiou is generally
in the control of the artist (violinist or ringer). Disorderly
