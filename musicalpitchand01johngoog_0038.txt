chapter to pitch, and then one to sounds¹ and their differenoes.
The separation of souuds into two classes according as pitch
ie present or absent is implied (unless, to be sure, pitch is
attributed to all sounds whatsoever). The first classification
we meet with is that by which sounds which have a'pitch are
divided into two groups according to the nature of that pitch.
Ψόφοι, he says (Ptolemy, Herna, 1. iv, p. 8 Wallis), are either
ι’σότονοι or ἀνισότονοι; the former are sounds which are un-
ehangeable in the matter of pitch (όπσράλλοιιτοι κατὰ τὸν
τόνον), the latter are those which change their pitch (παρολ-
λόσσοντες).’

Ptolemy next takes ψόφοι ἅνισότονοι end divides them into
οἱ συνεχεῖς and οἱ διωρισμένοι.3 Definitions follow. ‘¹ Con·

¹The title os the chapter, rapi φθόγγων, sal τῶν ἐν αὐτοῖς δισφιρῦν, must
be wrong. Read περὶ ψόφων ari.

*The equality and inequality ol pitch implied in the words ι’σότονος and
ἀνισότονοτ refer, of course, in this passage to the possibility of change which
any sound may undergo in the course of its existence But these terma are
also used in a very different senso-a sense which is met with in the next
chapter ol Ptolemy's treatise, and even at the eud ol the present chapter.
Ambiguity in the use ol terms has always been in Music a peculiarly fertile
sounae of misunderstanding. The difference in the meanings is well stated
by Porphyry in his commentary on this passage (ammanus, e. 4, p. 258
Wallis). The second use ol the words will not cause any difficulty, since
the differenee is so clear. In this meaning the τόνος refers to the pitch ol
notes as compared with atter notes, and used in this way the terms are ol fre·
quent service in demonstratione of the Pythagorean theory of consonanoes.
Porphyry’s words are: ῥητέον πόλιν, os ἷσότονοι ό ψόφος λέγεται διχῶς· ό μὲν
ἄλλην ψόφῳ όσην τὴν τόσον κεκτημένοι, ὥσπερ ἦ νήτη συνημμένων τῇ παρανήτη
διεζευγμένων λέγεται εἶναι ἲσότσνσς. (Similarly we might say that Ε sharp
in the hey os Β Major was ‘equitanie' with F, or 0 sharp with D flat.) Such
an ἲτότονοτ ψόφος, Porphyry continues, is more properly called operosos, and
not merely ψόφος, but φθόγγος. 'l'he other meaning refers to the parts of
one and the mma sound, as the beginning, middle, and end. Such a sound,
he says, might with more exaotness be called όμοιομερήι.

⁸1t may be well at this point to tabulate Ptolemy’s classes ol souuds:

όσότονοι.
