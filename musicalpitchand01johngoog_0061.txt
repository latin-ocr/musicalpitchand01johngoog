from facts presented to us in the history of modern theory, it
is not extravagant to suppose that intervals of nearly the same
siue as the Tone were often mistahen for the Tone‚ aud that
the Tonc personated these intervals, so to speah. If there
were intervals in ancient Greek scales whose sine differed from
⁸ that of the Tone in question by only a small amount (and the
existence of such intervals is not only possible, but is distinctly
asserted by many of the anoients), it would be a most natural
error to suppose such intervals to be actual Tones and to call
them Tunes and to tune them as such on instrumente. Yet
they would not for all that be the same interval as the Tone‚
nor would they cease to be intoned according to the dictates of
artistic feeling whenever the instrument permitted thieto be
done, as in vocal music. In modern music there are two
intervals, approaching the Tone (more accurately called the
Major-tone) in point of siue, which are used quite as freely as
it is. They arethe Supersecond or Septimal-second (ratio 728)
and the Minor-tone (ratio 9 ε10), one wider, the other narrower‚
than the Major-tone (rutio 829). These intervals can be
accurately intoned in vocal and violin music, but on keyed
instrumente (with the usual number of heys) they are all
three represented by the same tempered interval. The small
inaccuracies are overlooked, aud the intervals are all called
Tones elike. A similar state of affairs may have existed in
ancient music. scales iu which Major-tenes predominate are
open to suspicion on that account. In the next paragraph we
shall see that the scale constructed in the Timauo of Plato is
Δ artificial in this respect.

The earliest passage in which the consonant ratioe are
mentioned is perhaps Plato, Timaeus, 35 B, sq.1 It is to be
observed, however, that there is nowhere any reference to
music in the text. The scale here constructed is essentiallya
theoretical one. The procedure ie as follows. First, the
