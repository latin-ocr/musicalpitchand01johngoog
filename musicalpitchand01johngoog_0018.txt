theta melody may be said to romain the same. In the one
case we have the familiar phenomenon of a change of hey 3 in
the other,a change of the ‘tempo‚' ι’. c.,the speed with which the
music is performed. In both, the notes bear the saon relation
to one another as before; there has been a change in the abso-
lute values alone. But in general it is true thet the pitches
and duratione are casentini, while the quality and loudness are
accidentnh in the formation of melodice. We cannot replace
a note of one pitch by a note of another, nor change the
rhythm by lengthening or shortening notes at pleasure with·
out affecting the nature and characteres the tune.l ¹

If now the problem is presented to the student of ancient
music to reproduoe the sounds of any pisce of that music for
which we are so fortunate as to possess the written notes, the
most important points to be determined will bc the pitches of
the notes and their differences in duration. We may safely
leave such matters aethe right degrees of loudness and solt-
ness, and the clement of speed or the tempo to our own toste.
The quality of the tonos will depend on the character of the
music, whether vocal or instrumental, and if instrumental, we
must rely on our knowledge cf ancient musical instrumente.
But the rhythm and the melody (in narrower sense) are matters
of primary importance. ⁸

There is a very considerable difference, however, in the
difficulty of determining the exact equivalents sor the symbols

²It is not intended in the above statement to assert that rhythm is in·
dependent of lcudnesa, lor rhythm is based on the recurrence oi a suess at
equal intervals oi time. But inasmuch as, in music il not in poetry, that
sound which from its position would ordinarily bear the strecs may port
ott its strecs in favor of s succeeding note, or may be altogether αόειπί, it
would seem that the strecs feature of rhythm was derived from the sequence
oi long and short duratious of the notes, t c„ from their metro, taken in
connection with the pitch of the notes (in the case of music). In other
words, it a tunsis played absolutely without suem, the time will manifest
itself in spite of all through the character oi the tune. But, be this as it
may, if the reader will exclude streoe from the term loudness, the state·
