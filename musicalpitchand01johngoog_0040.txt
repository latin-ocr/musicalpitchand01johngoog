ous and the discrete or intervallate. And just as these two
motione are appropriate to speech end song respectively, so
ψόφοι συνεχεῖς, having no unity (Prot, Ham„ 1. iv„ p. 8
Wallis: μηδαμῆ μηθὲν ὑποβάλλοντες ἓν καῖ ταύτό), ere un-
suitable for musio, while ψόφοι διωρισμένοι cre suitable‚ and
are now, aster the definitione have been eompleted‚ called by
Ptolemy φθόγγοι (ibid, p. 9: καὶ δὴ φθόγγους ἤδη καλοῖμεν
’ όν τοὺς τοιούτους, ὅτι φθόγγος ἐστὶ ψόφος ἔνο καὶ τὸν αὐτὸν
ἐπέχων τόνον).

But if discrete sounds are φθόγγοι and keep the seme pitch,
why ere they clessed by Ptolemy with ψόφοι ἀνισότονοι rather
than with ι’σότονοιῖ Itis evident ιλιι discrete sounds may
be analyzed into a series of ι’σότονοι. They are ἀνισότονοι
only with reference to one another 3 each regarded by itself is
ι’σότονος. It would seem that Ptolemy had in mind lsrgemasses
orgroupsofsounds. Aean example of ψόφοι ἰσότονοι λε might
λινε given the tones of such instrumente ιι can produce only
one note, like certain whistles and horus or the eymbnls. The
difficulty arises from attempting to regard ιε a unit too great
a body of sound, too long a period of time. It is beet to
analyne such sounds es the tunes of a flute into ι series of
seperate sounde. This Ptolemy does not seem ιο λινε done.
Wishing to include in his olassificatiou his ψόφοι ἀνισότονοι
συνεχεῖς, end being unable to ohoose e simple unit from the
mess of wavering sound, he seems to have been led ιο include
among the ἀνισότονοι sounds which differed from the ebove
es singing differs from speaking. In this wey the old Aris·
toxenean treatment of κίνησις φωνῆς crops out.¹

If now we compare Ptolemy's elessificetion of sounds with

Aristides' clessifioation of the kinds of κίνησις φωνῆς (see the
tebles on pp. 23¹ and 24³), it will be observed that the same

¹The two uses (see p. 24¹) ol the words ισότινιι end ινισιτινοι are thus
in danger ol lesing their distinction ol meaning, is it is permitted to regere
a number ol sounds ss one. In the term suggested by Porphyry‚ ιμοιιμερήι
(and ινιμοιιμερής, il used), the μέρη are better regarded as separate soturde.
