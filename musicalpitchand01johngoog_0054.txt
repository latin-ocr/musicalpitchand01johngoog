urcment than the Semitone. Whether or not the subtle
refinements known as Chroai‚ which were varieties of the
quartat-tone system (penus clamantem) and of the third·
tone system (penus chromaticum), corresponded to phenomena
actually observed, the fact remains that Greek theoretical
writers used thirticths and even sixtieths of the Fourth in
their explanatione of these various penore. These intervals
would then be twelsths and twenty-fourths of a compromise
Tone obtained by taking exactly two-lifths of a Fourth. It ,
is easy to see that a mean Tone of this sine is not equal to an
aquai-temperament Tone‚ because a Fourth falls short of five
equal-temperament Semitones, and consequently two-fifths of
a Fourth fall short of an ‘equnl' Tone. Moreover, this mean
Tene, depending as it does on the Fourth, like the Fourth‚ is
not an aliquot part of the Octave. In like manner neither
the thirtieth nor the sixtieth partos a Fourth is an aliquot
part of the Octavo. In their more accurate measurements of
'intervals the Greeks used the Fourth as a standard of length,
where moderas use the Octave. In this respect and in some
others the Fonrth played the part now taken by the Octava.
For rougher calculatione, as we have seen, the Tone and the
Semitone-sixth and twellth of the Octave respectively—wero
used. But the most perfect of all the methods is that in which
the siae of intervals is determined by the ratio¹ between the
numbers found to belong to the notes.

¹Ratio is defined by Euclid in the following words (Euclio, Elemmts, V.
det. 3): “ Ratio is a mutual relation of two magnitudes ol the same kind to
one another in respect cf quantity,” or rather of “quantuplieityr’ It is
immaterial which of the two magnitudes first receives the attention ot the
mind. It is also a matter ol indifferenoe which term of a ratio is regarded
as compared with the other, whether the larger is compared with the
smaller or the smallsr with the larger‚ provided one or the other method is
consistently adhered to during one and the same operation. It is usual to
consider the term first mentioned to be compared with the term last men-
tioned, aa 2 to 3, i. a, 2 compared with 3. But if we wish to compare two
ratios, as 223 and 527, to see which is the largcr or wider, we may either
take the antecedente, 2 and 5, as standards, and so proceed to change the
