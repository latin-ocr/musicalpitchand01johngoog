notes.¹ Once again, it is possible to show the consonant ratios
from the positiones the linger-holos on flutes (ιιιίλοί).2 The
measurements are made from the mouth-pisce downward.

In all of these experiments for determining the ratioS, the
correspondence between the ratios and the sensations is com·
plete. In the words of the Peripatetic philosopher, Adrastus
(Theo Smyrn, de mrsu, c. 13, p. 61,ιο Hiller): τούτοις τοῖς
εἰς τὴν ἀνεύρεσιν τῶν συμφωνιῶν ὀργάνοις κατὰ μὲν τοὺς
λόγους τροτιιριισκευασθεῖσιν ἡ αἴσθησις ἐπιμαρτυρεῖ, τῇ δὲ
αἰσθήσει προσληφθείση ὁ λόγος ἐφαρμόζει. Νοι only do the
consonances give the rados, hut the ratios give the consonanoes.

We have just noticed that the quaternion of the first four
numbers, 1-2-3-4, is mentioned by Theon as containing
all the consonant ratios. Hc returns to it at chapter 37
(p. 93, w Hiller), where it is called ἡ τῆς δεκάδος τετρακτύς,
οεοιιυεο the sum of the four terms is 10. They are, cf course,
in arithmetical progression. Theon next considers the two-
branched quaternion of the Timaeus, in which the ternis are
in geometrical progression, end remarks in the course of his
exposition that the ratios of the consonances arc ιο be found
in these terms.

This double quaternion seems ιο have been used by thc
Pythagoreans tc illustrate varicus musical conceptione. We
now turn to Plutarch's treatise de οιιιιιιιιι procreatione ιἰι
Timaeo Plutonis, ο. 30, 1027 F, followed by c. 11,10170,
where the matter is discussed at considerable length.3

lPlutarch falls into this error in an interesting passage in the de οιιιιιηοκ
ριοονιαιιοηι. After giving the ratius of the consonant intervals, hc says
(0.17,1021Α); ἔξεστι δὲ καί νῦν βασανίσαι τάληθές, ll βάρη δυεῖν ιινισα χορδῶν
ἐξαρτήσαντας ll δυεῖν ἰσοκοίλων αιλῶν τιν ἕτερον μήκει διπλάσιον τοῦ ἑτέρου
ποιήσαντας· τῶν μὲνγὰρ αῧλῶν ι μείζων βαρύτερον φθέγξεται ὡς ὑπάτη ripis
νήτην, τῶν δὲ χορδῶνὴ τῷ διπλασίῳ κατατεινομένη βιίρει τῆς ἑτέροις ὀξύτερον
ὥς νήτη πρὸς ὑπάτην· τοῦτο δ’ ἐστι διὰ πασῶν.
