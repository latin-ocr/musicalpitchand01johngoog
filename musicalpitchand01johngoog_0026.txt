this, the usual delinition, is open to oritioism in tho following
particulare. In the first ploos, it excludes from the oategory
of musioal sounds thot union or binding of two notos known
as portnmento, whioh the violin olnoe of instrumente and the
voioe are capable of producing3 ior portamento must evidently
be defined as a gradual change of pitoh between lixed limite.
In the second plaoe‚ it admits suoh sounds us the touss of
badly made belle, in which the piton, suoh as it is, may romain
oonstaut and steady, but whioh it is best to olnss with non·
musioal sounds. Lastly, before tho steadiness or the unsteadi-
ness of the pitoh of a sound is made the basis for a olassifioation,
would it not bo better to seleot the aetual presenoe or absenos of
pitoh in the oomposition of tho soundt To bo sure, this would
not enable us to drew a hurd and fast line, owing to the faot
that pitoh may bs present in varying quantities, but at least
wo oould seperate those sounds in whioh it is impossible to
moogniae any traoe ol pitoh from those in whioh it is present
to some extent, those sounds whioh are purely noisy from
those whioh ars to a oertain extent musical. Alber that the
stendiness or unsteadiness ol the pitoh oould be used in mak-
ing a subdivisiones pitoh-sounds, iu whioh the sub-oluss of
sounds of stsady pitoh would eorrespond to the olass of musi·
ool sounds as eommonly defined.

But thore still remains the twofold objectiou that the pseu-

liar variation in pitoh above mentioned (portumento) is elassed
with ‘non-musioal' souuds, although it is distinctly musioel,
and that suoh munds as the tonos of badly east bells, whose
pitoh is oooasionally sleady, are olnssed with musiool sounds,
although they ars esseutially noisy.
