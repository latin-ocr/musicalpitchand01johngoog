11 forms two parallelograms, one 3 by 12, the other 4 by 9.
If now (1018 D) we take 6 (the side of the square) and 8 (the
side of the triangle) and 9 and 12 (sides of the two parallelo-
grams), we have in these numbers the ratios 01 the consonances.

There are a number of passages in the following chapters
01 the de animoa procreatione in which the consonant ratios
are given, but they are not important enough to be quoted,
being for the most part but repetitions 01 former statements.
Buta few words should be said in regard to the two dissonant
intervals, the Tone and the Leimrna, which are closely con·
nected with the consonances. We have already remarked
(p. 46) that the Tone (i. 0., the Major Whole-tone, ratio 819)
owes its prcminence largely to the fact that it is the difference
in width 01 the Fisth and the Fourth3 and the Leimma 10
important in the formation of certain scales (for example, the
scales in the 1111100111), owing to the fact that it is the interval
which must be added to two and to three Tones to make the
Fourth and the Fisth respectively.

The Pythagoreans associated two numbers with these inter-
vals, 13 with the Ieimma,¹ and 27 with the Tcne. It is easily
seen that these numbers express approximately the relative size
01 the intervals, 101 the Fourth is a little less than two Tones and
011011,00111011110110111111191001111101000 than an exact Semitone.
The mcthcd 01 obtaining these numbers will now bc given.

In regard to the Leimma, the number is derived directly
from the ratio 243 : 256 (which we obtain by dividing the ratio
01 the Fourth by that 01 the Ditone, 01 Pythagorean Third

(= two Tenes), as 101101101- 3, ⁸ 3 ⁸1 243

nothing more nor less than the arithmetical difference bet tween
the two terma.

Itis, of course, illogical 10 identify an interval with the
absolute difference 01 two numbers which express its ratio.
