either for counting the number of vibratione or for accurately
measuring small intervals of time like the second. Oonse·
quently ancient determinations of the ratios of intervsls were
generally based on other consideratione. The most convenient
method consisted of a comparison of the lengths of the strings
which produce the required notes, when the strings are made of
auniform thickness and are subjected to the same tension.
As it happens, the lengths of strings are inversely propor-
tional to their vibrationnumbers, so that results obtained by
oue method may readily be compared with those obtained by
the other. This is most easily done when two notes only are
involved, but the comparisou is made without difficulty even
when there is a series of notes. Other methods employed were
the comparison of the lengths of the pipes of wind instrumente
cf equal bore 3 the comparison of the distances at which finger-
holes must be bored to produce given notes ; and the compari-
son of the weights necessary to stretch strings of equal length
as well as size, so as to produce notes which will form the

· required interval.1 Only very rough results could have been

obtained from the methods last mentioned. In the caseos

instrumenta like the flute (αὐλός) it is very difficult to deter-
mine accurately the length of the vibrating column of eir, and
it is necessary that the bore of the instrument be of uniform

siae throughout and that the sine of the finger-holes be the
same. A hole of smaller diameter may be substituted for one
of larger diameter further removed from the mouth-picce.
Ancient {inte-makers undoubtedly availed themselves of this
principle in tuning their instrumente.² For ascertaining in·
terval ratios by measuring the distances at which the holes are
placed it would be necessary to have holes of one sine only.

In using strings of equal length and thickness, stretched by
hanging weights of different sines, great cere would have tc be
