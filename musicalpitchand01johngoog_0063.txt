differs from its neighbors by an interval of either 928 cr
256 ε 243, that is, every step is either a Tune or a Leimma.
The scale formed on the binary branch of the tetraetys has a
compass of three Octaves, each Ootave containing 5 Tones and
2 Leimmata. The scale formed on the ternary branch¹ has a
compass of three Twelfths, each Twelsth or Dodecachord being
of the form: nete diezeugmenon-mese-hypate meson—pros-
lambanomenes,² in which the intervals are Fifth, Fourth,
Fifch, and form together an Octsve like the Octave of the
binary scale, ptos the interval of a Fisth towards the bass,
hypate meson—proslambanomenus. Eaeh of the three Do-
decachords, then, contains 8 Tenes and 3 Leimmata, when
the scale is completed.

The fact that the compass of each of these scales is much
larger than that of any scale described in the musical treatises
goes far towards showing that they are not to be regarded
as actual musical scales.³ In the ternary scale there is the
further objection that each of the three Dodecachords is in a
different hey. In other words, the ternary scale passes into
two new heys.

Tha question, then, naturally occurs, Are these scales musi-
eal scales at all in the modern sense of the word musical? Do
they not rather belong to the music of numbers (ἡ ἐν ἀριθμοῖς
μουσική)1 The ancient commentatore on the passage them-
selves support this view. It is admitted by AdrastuS, quoted

by Theo Smyrnaeus, de musica, c. 13 (p. 64, sq. Hillo), that
the eompass uf scales actually used iu music falls far short of
that of the longer scale described by Plato, of which the
length is four Oetaves and a Major-sixth (= three Twelfths) 3
but it is pointed out that it was necessary to extend the scale
into cubic numbers, because they represent solide.⁴ In any
