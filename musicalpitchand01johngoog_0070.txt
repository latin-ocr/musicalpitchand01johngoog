The arces of the four compartments will then be 6, 8, 9, und
12 (sum, 35): 3 4

These numbers eontain the arithmetical progression 6—9-

12 and the harmonical progressiou 6-8-123 111 the former

we have the ratio of the Fisth (2 23) followed by that of the
Fourth (314),111 the latter, the order is reversed, while the
ratio of the extremes is that 01 the Octave (112), and the
ratio of the two means is that of the Tone (8 29). Διὰ τοῦτο

Plutarch next multiplies like powers of 2 and 3(chapter
13, 1018 B, sq.). The products, 6, 36, and 216, are, of course,
the first, second, and third powers of 6. In commenting on
these numbers, the remark is made that 36 is the smallest
number which is et once a square and a triangle, for it is
the square of 6 and the triangle² of 8 (τρίγωνος ἀπὸ τῆς

¹This Pythagorean ‘harmony' 0110111 notes is supposed to have been
discovered by the philosopher on his famous visit to the smithy, when he
noticed that the hammers used gave notes which formed the various oon·
sonsnces. κ On returning home, it is said, he fastened weights proportionsl
to those ο1 the hammers -10 four stringe os equal length, and thus obtained
the four notes of 1110 harmony. Of. lamblichus, 11110 of Pyttuporca, xxvr.

10111 110100 stand at the same intervals from one another as do the 101110,
subdeminant, dominant, and tonic again, in modern music. The arith·
metieal progression gives the dominant, and the harmonical progression
(so called 101 this reason) gives the subdominant.
