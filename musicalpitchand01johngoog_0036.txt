the ear learnt to appreciata the intervals and the mind to
retain the simple fragments of tune which resulted.'' The
Aristoxenean κίνησις συνεχής (fixed pitch entirely absent)
would thus seem to characterize the earliest attempta at musio,

whereas the κίνησις διαστηματική is peculiar to fully organ- '

ized music. It would even appear from the last part of the
passage quoted at p. 19 (ἐν δὲ τῷ μελῳδεῖν, etc.) that portamento
was avoided as much as possible by the Greeks in singing,
although it is likely that this phenomenon represents an inter-
mediate stage in the development of music. We quote again
from Mr. Parry's work on the Art os litate.l “At the very
bottom of the process of development are those savage howls
which have hardly any distinct notes in them at all. Many
travellers record such things, and try to represent them in the
European musical stave. For instance, the nativas of Aus-
tralia are described by a French traveller as beginning a howl
ona high note and descending a full octava in semitones.''
But the author shows that this mnnot be an accurate descrip-
tion of the process, “as a downward scale of correct semitones
is beyond the powers of any but very highly trained singers.''
“ In all such cases the process must have been a gliding of the
voice up or down, without notes that were strictly defined
either in relation to one another or to any general principle.''

Musieal notes must evidently have first made their appear-
ance when the bounds of such glides assumed a fixed nature
and relationship with each other. The statement in Helm-
holta² that “ The first fact that we meet with in the musicos
all nations, so far as is yet known, is that alterations of pitch
in melodias take place by intervals, and not by continuous
transitions,’' is at variance with the above. It seems to over-
look the fact that we can describe an interval equally well by
gliding through the space as by leaping over it.
