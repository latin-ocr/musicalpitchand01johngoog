PREFACE.

'lhe present dissertation, originally submitted to the authorities
in April, 1895, is now printed in conformity with the University
regulatious. I have thought it best to avail mysalf of the oppor-

tunity thus offered to make a number of changes and to expand Ι

1115 treatment in certain directions. Karl von J an's Musici Saip-
toeee (155551 (Bibliotheca Teubneriana, 1895), which appeared too
late 15 be oi service in the original preparation of the thosis, hae
been used for the quotatious from the Aristotelian Ptoblema aud
from the worhs of Euclio, Nicomachus, Gaudentius, and Bacchius.
Aristoxenus is quoted from the edition of Westphal (Vol. 11, edited
by F. Saran, Leipsic‚ 1893). Τ115 peges of Meibomius, Aatmane
Musicae ductores deplere, Amsterdam, 1652, are, however, retained
in making citatione from the authors embraced in this work.
For the musical trcatises of Claudius Ptolemy, Porphyry, and
Bryennius the only available text was that which is found in the
, third volume of John Wallis's Opere Molleceecte'ca, Oxford‚ 1699.
Ι take pleasure in achnowledging my great obligatior to the
authorities of the Boston Athenaeum for their courtesy in par-
mitting me to consult this rare work at leisure in my own home.
I am also indebted for the opportunity accorded me while in
England in 1894155551115 copies of Wallis and Meibomius
belonging to the Cambridge University Library.
