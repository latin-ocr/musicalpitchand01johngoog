double geometrioal quaternion or tetreetys of the Pytha·
goreana is formed by joining to unity the first three powers
of 2 and of 3, thus: 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 8, 27. This tetractys may
be arranged eo as to exhibit the two branohea oonsisting of
powers of 2 and 3, respectively‚ by making a Lambda,¹ as
follows: 1
2 3
4 9
8 27

The lest braneh contains the duple intervals (διπλάσια δια-
στήματα) and the right one the triple intervals (τριπλάσια
διαστήματα). Then between the terms of every interval the
harmonieal² and the arithmetioal means are inserted. In this
way two series are obtained: 1, t, l, 2, t, 3, 4, 131, 6, 83
and 1, l, 2, 3, l, 6, aas, 18, 27.
The successiones intervals in the first series, or lest branoh,
is t, l, 43 t, t, ὴ t, t, t ; the suooession in the seoond series,
or right branoh, is ff, ᾖ, {3 t, t, ἢ t, t, Β that is to say, in
the first series, the seeond term is t of the first, the third ff of
the seoond, eto. The explanation of these series is held by
eommentators to be that they refer to musical seales. The
ratios e and t will then correspond to the consonanoes of the
Fisth and the Fourth, their produnt (l><1=†) to the sum of
these intervals, the Octave, and their quotient (l -ζ- t = t) to
the differenoe, the Tone. The last step in the formationes
the scales is that by whieh every interval of 423 was filled
with intervals of 928 (as many as are contained therein), and
λείμματα, whose terms are as 256 to 243, the intervals of
322 being first resolved (by implioation) into intervals of 423
and 928. Soalee are therefore formed in whieh eaoh note

¹The harmonioal mean ia erroh that the differenoa between it end the
leaser extreme is the same part of the latter as tha differente between the
greater extreme and the harmonioal mean is of that extreme.
