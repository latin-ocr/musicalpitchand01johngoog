tity, when the question of finding ameum os measuring differ-
ence of pitch was presented, it would be natural ιο endeavor
to find a smallest possible interval which might serve as a
natural unit.

We have in Plato a reference to such attempta.

Plato, Repnthlic, VII„ p. 530 E: φ οὐκ οἷσθ’ ὅτι καὶ περὶ
ἁρμονίας ἕτερον τοιοῦτον ποιοῦσι,· τάς «γὰρ ἀκουομένας αὗ
συμφωνίας καὶ φθόηηους ἀλλήλοις ἀναμετροῦντες ἀνήνυτα
ὥσπερ οἱ ἀστρονόμοι πονοῦσι. νὴ τοὺς θεοὺς, ἔφη, καὶ ηε-
λοίως ηε, πυκνώματ’ ἄττα ὀνομάζοντες καὶ παραβάλλοντες τά
ὦτα, οἷον ἐκ ’γειτόνων φωνὴν θηρευόμενοι, οἱ μέν φασιν ἔτι
κατακούειν ἐν μέσῳ τινὰ ἠχὴν καὶ σμικρότατον εἶναι τοῦτο
διάστημα, φ μετρητέον, οἱ δὲ ἀμφισβητοῦντες ὡς ὅμοιον ἤδη
φθεγγομένων, ἀμφότεροι ὦτα τοῦ νοῦ προστησάμενοι. (Quoted
in Theo Smyrnaeus, p. 6 Hiller.)

But it is evident that iu dealing with the sensatior of pitch
there is the widest range for differences of opinion, and even
if a considerable number of competent persons could agree
that some given interval was the smallest difference of pitoh
which they could distinguish from unison, there would still
exist the necessity for finding a method of recording the
width of this interval, and this record must necessarily rest
on physical consideratione. Thus, in any exact methodos
measurement, final appeal will always have to be made to the
intelleot. The ear alone cannot be trusted to judge the width
of small dissonant intervals so accurately as to enable us to
measure larger intervals in terms of the smaller. When we
consider the difficulty of singing with accuraoy the ordinary
chromatio scale, with intervals so large as semitonea the im· '
possibility of obtaining certain results by means of the ear
alone will be apparent.

If, now, the attempt to find by ear a minute interval ιο
serve as a unit in measuring intervallar siae is doomsdto
failure‚ it naturally occurs ιο inquire if it is possible to select
for the unit one of the intervals found in actual use in musio.
Although the number of such intervals (called by the Greeks
