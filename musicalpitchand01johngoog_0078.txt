sound—on the supposition that of the intervals of the tone
the fitth is the first which can be sounded.'' In support
of this theory of the musical significationes 5 we have the
parallel cases of the numbers 13 and 27, whose connection
with musical intervals arises, as we have seen, from the terms
os the ratios (expressing their siae) derived from the mono-
chord withascaleof 256equal divisione. The three numbers, ·
5, 13, and 27, are then (not quite exactly) proportional to the s
sines of the intervals, the τροφόν, the λεῖμμα, and theTone,
since they are all three measured on the same scale. The
Pythagorean τροφόν is then, I take it, a small interval with
the ratio 2512256, and was connected with the number 5,
because 5 is the arithmetical difference between the terms of
the ratic, just as 13 and 27 are arithmetical differences.¹

In the foregoing peges we have cited and discussed some
os the more important passages in which the ratios of the
primary consonances are either established or assumed as
known, with the object of showing that the ancients were
thoroughly familiar with the numerical relations which exist

between musical notes, and that they made sree use of the
resulting ratios in measuring the siae of intervals. A con-
siderable number of additional passages could be adduced,
were it necessary in a matter which is osten taken for granted.
Moreover, it is not necessary in the case of the consonant
intervals to examine closely the value of the experimenta by

1In the explanation given above-that it is only when the minute in·
terval corresponding ιο the fifth of the 256 equal parts ol a vibrating string
is joined to the four which preceded that a ‘scnndable' intervalia obtained,
and that 5 stands for this intervaL-it is not a serious objecticn that the
writer first calls 5 a φθόγγος and then seems ιο identify it with an interval.
The confusion between a note and the interval which it forms with some
given note is of frequent occurrence3 each new sound brings in a new in·
lervel, ό. e. with the open etring. The difficulty can, however, be removed
by changing φθόγγον ιο φθόγγου or φθόγγων. If φθόγγον is kept, can it be
that ψόφον should be read for νροφόνῖ The clauae ὅπερ ἐστι φθόγγον would
seem ιο support this emendation in view os the fact that φθόγγος and ψόφος
vere not always careiully differentiated.
