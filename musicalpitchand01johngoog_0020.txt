corresponding intervals in connection with their occurrence in
actual melody and in the ancient scales. 'l'he subjectis the
measurement of intervals abstractly considered, irrespeotive of
their place in the scale and irrespeotive of their function in
tetual representation. Pitch is consequently considered, not
as a quality or property of musical sounds, but as a quantity,
which may be measured like any other quantity. And in ita
measurement we are not concerned so much with the absolute
position of notes on the scale of acuteness and graveness, aa
with their relative position. Since pitch lengths oan be meas·
ured only when the bounds are rigidly fixed, a discussion of
the musical anund will precede, involving a few words on the
olassification cf scunds and the place therein cf musical sounds
and cn the ancient conception cf pitch.

The ancient explanatione of sound as a physical phenome·
non, however insufficient from a modern point of view, are
accurate enough in geneml ior musical purposes. The im·
portant part played by the air, either aa the cause of sound or
aa the medium of its transmission to our ears, seems to have

been very universally recognized. Plato¹ defines sound asa ¹ ’

“ stroke transmitted through the ears by the air and passed
through the brain and the blood tc the soul.” That a blcw

is necessary for the production cf a anund seems to have been
brought out before the time of Archytas, for Archytas appr-oves

of this doctrine cf his predecessore in a passage quoted by
Porphyry in his commentae-iae cd Ptolemaeum, p. 236 Wallis
(Wallis, Opera Mathematicc, 111. p. 236).² But, according

qimau, xm. 6⁷ B: δλοις pir οδν φωνὴν θῶμεν τὴν δι’ ὤτοιν ὑπ’ &ipos
δγκεφιίλοο τε καὶ αἵματος μέχρι ψυχῆς πληγὴν διαδιδομένην. The transla-
tion iairom Mr. Archon-Hind's Editicu ci the usam See the notes on
this passage and on 80 A (peges 246 and 300).
