rival φαμεν ἠρεμίαν φωνῆς, τὰς δ’ ἐν τοῖς ἔμπροσθεν εὕρομεν
οὔσας κινήσεις τινάς). Convernely στάσις (or ἑστάναι) is
defined by the help oi τάσιςι δεῖ δὲ καταμανθάνειν ὅτι τὸ μὲν
ἑστάναι τὴν φωνὴν τὸ μένειν ἐπὶ μιᾶς τάσεάς ε’στι (i 32, p. 13
Mein). Of course, strictly speaking, what is defined in this
definition of τάσις is not so much ‘pitch' as ‘degree of pitoh.'

It is now necessary to compare some of the ancient classid-
oations of sounds with those of modern theory, and so to
discuss the φθόγγος ον ‘musical sound,' the uuit. of the scienoc
oi music.

Aristoxenus set the example for a number of followers by

leading up to the definition of the musical souud through a
careful analysis of what is termed κίνησις φωνῆς, the motion
of the νοιόε.1 Ηε says that a description of the various kinds
of κίνησις is necessary for the proper definition of the φθόγγος.1

Ιν this description it will not be difficult to see what sort of
a classifioation oi sounds Aristoxenus must be understood to
bave hod in mind.

Itis evident that the passage from one degree of pitch to
another must be made in ονε of two ways. Either the pitch
of a sound changes suddenly from the initial state to the final
state, in such a way that at no moment does the sound rest
at, or pass through, any intermediate degree of pitch; or the
pitch changes gradually in the direction of the final degree
of pitoh, that is, either upward or downward‚ and so passes
through every possible intermediate degree, bnt rests at noue.
These are the only two ways in which a sound emanating
from one and the same instrument can pass from ονε pitoh to
another. They may be compared to stepping and gliding.
In the one case the intermediate space is leapt over, in the
other it is traversed.

’Φανή is here used oi the tenes of musical instrumenta in general, not of
the voice alone. See above, pp. 9, 10.

'Aristoxenua Harmonice, 1. φ 4, p. 3 Meib.: uni τοι τούτου μὴ διορισθέντοε
οὐ πάνυ ῥᾴδιον εἰπεῖν περὶ φθόγγον τί ποτ’ ἐστίν.
