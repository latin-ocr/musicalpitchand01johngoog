· means of which the ancients made their original determina·
tione of these retica, inasmuch as the true ratio of a conso·
nance could have been derived,¹ and as a matter of fact
must have been derived in the first instance, from imperfect
observatione by a sort of intuitive preference for simple
ratios. But when one comes to the consideration of the
numerous divisione of the tetrachord according to pecus and
chroc (color), in which Greek musical theory abounded‚ it
becomes important to ascertain whether the measurements
given for these dissonant intervals by the method of ratios
are to be trusted as true iudications of their siue. Many of
these intervals are sc utterly foreign to modern European
music that it is difficolt to believe that they were actually of
the width ascribed to them. We referto such intervals as
the Quartertones in the enharmonio pecua, the intervals oi
three-quartale and five-quarters of a Tone in the διάτονον
μαλακόν, and the intervals in the χρῶμα μαλακόν and
χρῶμα ἡμιόλιον. ,

The degree of accuracy attainable in measuring the siae of
any interval depende upon several consideratione. In the
first place intervals differ vastly among themselves in the
exactness with which they may be tuncd.l Variations may
be due to the failure cf the experimenters to obtain uniformly
the ideal intonation of the interval. In the next place inter-
vals of nearly the same siae are apt to be confounded. We
have already alluded to the fact that in modern music the
interval known to musiniano as the Tone is notan interval of
fixed width. In the same way the term Semitoneis used now

¹ A. J. Ellis is unwilling to give the ancients credit for accuracy in these
measurements. He says (Helmholta, Seamtiomcs Tene, ind Eng. ed„ p. 15,
note *l : “Aa the monochcrd is very liable to error, these results vere happy
generalisaticns from necessarily imperfect experiments.” But Helmholta
says (cp. cit, p. 14): “These measurements hed been executed with great
precision by the Greek musicians, and had given rise to a system of tenes,
contrived with considerable art.”
