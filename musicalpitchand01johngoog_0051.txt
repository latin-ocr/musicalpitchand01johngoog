The question before us ie then equivaleut to the following=
Are these linear distances commensurable or incommensu-
rablel¹ The answer must here be given without proof,
although its truth is susceptible of mathematical demonstra-
tion. Itis that not one of the more usual intervals found in
actual music is commensurable with any other, nor is it possible
to find an interval of any size that will not be incommensu-
rable with almost every interval which, from its occurrence in
music, we might desire to measure.

Intervals like the Octave‚ Fisth, Major-tone, etc, which the
ear recognitas as having a special claim to a name and place
in every musical system, are all incommensurable with oue
another. No two distances (on the line of pitch) corresponding
to intervels cf actual occurrence in natural music can be ex-
pressed in terme cf a common unit.² Nor can any distance
be discovered, however small or large, which will serve our
purpose with any greater success.

The cause for this state of affairs is found in the well-known
fact that all intervals are expressible in terme of ratios, which
are derived from physical phenomena. As has been noticed

before (p. 14), pitch depende on the number of vibratione of
the air generated in any period of time by the cause of the
, sound. The ratio between the vibration·numbers of two
notes expresses the siae of the interval. Since, now, to com-
-pouud two ratius itis necessary to multiply them together,

ιΤυνο quantities are commensurable when there is a third quantity which
is contained an exact number of times in each.

’One or two evident exceptione need cause no trouble in accepting the
essential truth ol this doctrine. The Donble Octave and the Double Fifth
(= Octava -}· Maj0r·tone)‚ for example, are obviously twice the siae ol the
single Octava and Fisth, respectively. Again, after selecting a uuit (lor
example, the Tone) nothing oen prevent us from comtractiop intervals of
twice or any number ol times the siae, as the Pythagorean Major-third
(see below, p. 38); but the resulting intervals in this latter case are not
truly musical intervals, but are generally approximatione to natural inter-
vals. Of this more will be said ou p. 47.
