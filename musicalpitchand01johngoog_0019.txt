used ιο denote pitch, and for those used to mark the rhythm.
In fact in moetos the known remains of Greek music, the
rhythm is lest to be determined by the metre of the words to
which the music was sung. It will moreover medily be ad-
mitted that errors in the interpretation of the rhythm would
not result in so thorough a misunderstanding as would errors
in the translation of the pitch-values of the ancient notes.

The first step in this important'determination of the pitch·
values may well be to discover the order or succession of the
notes in the matter of acuteuess and graveness. The next
would then be to ascertain the exact distances at which the
notes stand with reference ιο one another. As to the mere
order of the notes, several of the ancient trectises supply us
with this information, but when the notes are enumeratedbp
uuum alone and not by written symbol, we must still obtain
a correspondence between the written notes and their names.
This we are able todo by means of the diagrams which are
found in the invaluable work of Alypius, and in the works of
Gaudentius and Bacchius Senior. By means of this informa·
tion alone we could plot a curve os any ancient melody, such
that every rise and sall in pitch was represented, and only the
amount of this motion would romain undetermined. The

second step supplies this deficiency. We ascertain for each
note the distance or interval at which it stands from its neigh-
bors. This done, we are in possessiones all the knowledge
necessary to reproduce the sounds denoted by the ancient no-
tation. Our ability ιο tracanto the notation correetly into
the modern notation, and to reproduce the sounds vooally or
instrumentally, will, of course, depend for the most part on
the similarity of the music in question ιο modern music.

The present dissertation is conoerned with this second step,
and isan attempt to show to what extent our knowledge of
the absolute width of musical intervals in general among the
Greeks is based on firm foundations. No attempt is made to
show what are the modern equivalents for the actual notes
employed in their music, nor to establish the width of the
