αὐλοῖς τῷ διπλασίῳ διαστήματι λαμβάνεται τὸ διδ πασῶν,
καὶ οἱ σύλοτρῦπαι οὕτω λαμβάνουσιν. καὶ οἱ τάς σύριγγας
άρμοττάμενοι εἰς μὲν τὴν ὑπάτην ἄκραν τὸν κηρὸν ἐμπλάτ-
τονσι, τὴν δὲ νήτην μέχρι τοῦ ἡμίσεος ἀναπληροῦσιν. ὁμοίως
δὲ καὶ τὴν διδ πέντε τῷ ἡμιολίῳ κοίτην διὰ τεττάρων τῷ
ἐπιτρίτῳ διαστήματι λαμβάνουσιν. έτι καί ἐν τοῖς τριγώνοις
ψαλτηρίοις τῆς ίσης ἐπιτάσεως γινομένης συμφωνοῦσι διδ
πασῶν ή μὲν διπλασία οὖσα ή δὲ ήμίσειο τῷ μήκει.

Ιόῖά., 50 (p. 111 Κ. v. J) Διδ τί ίσων πίθων καὶ ὁμοίων
ε’δν μὲν ὁ ἕτερος κενὸς ᾖ, ὁ δὲ ἕτερος εἰς τὸ ἥμισυ διάμεστος,
διδ πασῶν συμφωνεῖ ἡ ήχώ ,·-Ἧ ὅτι διπλασία γίνεται ἡ ἐκ
τοῦ ήμίσεος τῆς ἐκ τοῦ κενοῦ,· τί γὰρ διαφέρει τοῦτο ἢ ἐπὶ τῶν
συρίγγων,· δοκεῖ γὰρ ή θάττων κίνησις ὀξυτέρα εῖναι, ἐν δὲ
τοῖς μείζοσι βραδύτερον ὁ ἀὴρ ἀπαντᾷ, καὶ ἐν τοῖς διπλασίοις
τοσούτῳ καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἄλλοις ἀνάλογον. συμφωνεῖ δὲ διὰ πασῶν
καὶ ὁ διπλασίων ἀσκὸς πρὸς τὸν ήμισυν.

Theo Smyrnaeus devores a number of paragraphs in his
treatise de rrtrcsioo1 to the ratios which are associated with the
intervals. He gives the ratios of six consonant intervals and
of the Tone and the Semitone or Diesis² (de mos, c. 12, p. oca
Hiller), discovered by Pythagoras, by comparing the length
and thickness of strings and their tension, as shown by the
turning of the pegs or by hanging weights, and by comparing
the bore of the cavities of wind-instrumente and the soree of
the breath, and the massas and weights of sounding disos and
vessels, It is then shown bow the monochord (see above, p.
43) is employed to illustrate the consonant ratios (p. 57,11
Hiller). The string is divided into 4 equal parts, of which 3
give a sound aFourth above that given by the whole string,
2(the half-string) give the Ootave above, and 1 part gives the

lTho de marsico is the second of the three sections into which Theon's
copositio rorum mathematicorum od lacendum Platonem utilium is divided. It
covers pp. 46, 20-119, tin. in Hiller's edition (Teubner, 1878).

'The Pythagoream called the Semitone both λεῖμμα and δίεσις, but the
Aristoxeneans used the latter term for the Quartentone of the enharmonio
ρεναι. Of. Thoonem, loc. cit, p. 55 Hiller.
