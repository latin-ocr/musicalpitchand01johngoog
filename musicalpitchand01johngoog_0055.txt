Pythagoras¹ is accredited with making the discovery of the
numerical relations exieting between musical scunds, and the
Pythagorean School² always made ratio the basis of their in-
vestigatione. They demonstrated³ by the use of ratios that
certain intervals are not divisible into exaotly equal parts.

This would seem ιο show that they appreciated the difficulties
connected with the ‘linear' measurement cf intervals (so to
call it), and knew that the majority of musical intervals are
incommensurable with one another iu respect of their siae.
But in the ratios they found a method of measuring intervals
in which the difficulties caused by this characteristic feature
in the constitution of musical intervale do not obtrude them-
selvee.

Given any two notes, their interval may be calculated by
finding the vibratum-numbers and deduoing the ratio. But
the ancients are not known to have had any satisfactory meane

terme of the ratice until the antecedente are the acme, and then compare the
consequente (thus, 223=1021t and 527=1021e therefore 223 is wider,
because 16 is larger than 14), or we may regard the consequente, 3 and 7,
aa standarde of comparison and compare 14:21 with 15:21. The latter
method is more usual, because retice may be regarded ae fractione. The
consequente then become denominatore, and the fractione are compared by
reduoing ιο a common denominator and comparing the numerators (ἓ-εῆς
ιε fl). But it would be just aa legitimate to reduce the numerators to a
common numerator, 10, and then to compare the denominatore, 16 and 14
(t=lt; l= 11)·

¹We have the following statement of Xenocrates, as quoted by Heraclides
Ponticus. The passage is found in an excerpt from Heraclides’ Εἷσαγογὴ
Μουσικὴ given by Porphyry.
