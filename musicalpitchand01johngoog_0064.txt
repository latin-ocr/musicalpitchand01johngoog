case, even if the scales are purely numerical scales, they seem
to have been suggested by musical scales iu actual use, and
may be illustrated end explained by suppodng them to be

musical. We may safely see in the intervals between the
terme of the series references to the ratios associated with
musical intervals.

We have in Euclid's sectio ccccm? the earliest statement
in which the ratios² are explicitly given for the musical con·
sonauces. The first nine theorema (ten in MeibomiuS,Actiq1tae
Murteae Auctoree Septem) are purely mathematioal, dealing
with the ratics. In 10 (11 Meib.) the author proves that

the interval διὰ πασῶν is multiple; in 11 (12) thet the tut
τεσσάρων and oe πέντε are each superparticular3 in 12 (13-
15) that the ratio of the διὰ πασῶν is 221, that the ratios of

’A teu words ought at this point to be said in explanation of the tech-
nical terma used in the arithmetic os the Greeks for various sorte of ratios.
When the greater term of a ratio was compared r'rith the lesser, and ao
usually preceded it, the ratio was called rptaoym when the leeser was
compared with the greater, the rati0 was called ὑπόλογος. There uas
also a distinction of three kinds of ratioe according as the antecedent uas
greater than, was equal to, or rras lesa than, the consequent, as in Theo Smyr-
naeus, de musica, c. 22 (p. 74 Hiller): τῶν tt λόγον ol μέν εἶσι μείζονες, οἱ dl
ἐλάττονες, ot Ησοι. Eqnal ratios are those in which the terms are equal.
Of ratios where the first term is greater than the second, five kinds were
distinguished: λόγοι πολλαπλάσιοι, λ. ἐπιμόριοι, λ. ἐτιμερεΐς, λ. amarmu-
επιμίριοι, and λ. οολλοπλονιεπιμερεῖς. A multiple ratio is one whose first term
contains the second an exact number of times (cp. cit, c. 23, p. 78,ο Hiller);
a erpepurtieulur ratio is one whose first term contains the second once and
also an aliquot part ol the second (c. 24, p. 76, ιι), a φησι-11111 ratio is
one whose first term contains the second once and also more than one aliquot
partos the second (c. 25, p. 78, ο); multiplezeapeparttenlur (c. 26, p. 78, ar)
aud ercammarum (e 27, p. 71111) ratius are like the laet two kinds,
hut the first terma contain the second terme more than once, plue a fraction.
Theon gives a sixth kind (op. eit, e 28, p. 80, r), namely, λόγος ἀριθμοῦ πρὸς
&proptr (found also in Ptolemy, Ηαηλ, 1. ν, p. 10 Wallis). Ido not see why
this is not included under one ot the other kinds. The example gironis
the ratic of 256 to 248, which is superpartieut. The ὑπόλογον have the same
names as the πρόλογον with the prefix ὑπο· added, as efferremus.
