and not, of course, to add them, it follows that the sum of
two intervals cannot be obtained by direct addition of their
ratios, narare ratios so related that a common constituent can
be found which could serve as a measure of their relative sine.
“If we wish to have a measure of intervals in the proper
sense, we must take, not the characteristic ratio itself, but the
logarithm of that ratio. Then, and then only, will the measure
of a compound interval be the sum of the measures of the
components,'' ¹ and when this has been done all the logarithms‚
with a few exceptione, will he found to he incommensurable.
But of course, the sine of any interval ean be calculated to
any required degree of accuracy.

This great fact of the incommensurability of musical inter-
vals was known to the Greeks. It was recognized to he true
both practically and theoretically. The eleventh chapter of
the first book of Ptolemy’s Harmonice contains first a mathe- ¹
matical demonstration that six Tones exceed an Octave, and
the amount of this excess, it is then stated, is perceptible coca
lottecar. Earlier writers than Ptolemy prove mathematically
that six Tones exceed an Octavo hyan interval (called the
Pythagorean Comma) whose ratio is 524,288 :531,441. Since
this excess is slightly larger than the Comma of Didymus
(80 : 81) which is the difference between the Major and the
Minor Wholetone (or between the true or just Major-third
and the Pythagorean Major-third), Ptolemy's statement is not ·
in the least incredible. All the difficulties sought to he obvi-
ated by the device of equal temperament arise from small
intervals, which are rarely larger than the Comma (80:81)
by even a quarter of its size. If such intervals are felt by

moderna, we cannot deny to the ancients ability to perceive
small intervals of the same aize. The existence of Quarten-
tones at one period, at least„in the development of Greek

music, points to a high degree of cultivation among the
ancients of the feeling for pitohdifferenoes.
