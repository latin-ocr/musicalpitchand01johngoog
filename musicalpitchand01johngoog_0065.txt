the διὰ πέντε and διὰ τεσσάρων are 322 and 423 respectively,
that the ratio of the διὰ πέντε καὶ διὰ πασῶν is 321, and
that the ratio of the δὶς διὰ πασῶν is 421. Theorems 13-16
(16-19) deal with the διάστημα τονιαῖον οι· τόνος, ratio 928,
and show that the Octeve is less than six Tones, end that the
Fourth is less than two Tones ond a Half-tone, and the Fifth
than three Tones ond a Half-tone. Theorem 16 shows that
the Tone cannot be divided into two equal parts.l Sinos the
proof is based on the fact thet a superparticular ratio cannot
be so divided, the same argument would show that the Fifth
and the Fourth and other intervals with superparticular ratios
are lihewise indivisible into equal parts.

The Aristotelian Probhms, even if they ere not the work of
, Aristotle‚ are thought to be not much later in date than his
time. The Nineteenth Section, entitled Ὅσα περὶ ἁρμονίαν,

contains a number of passages in which the interval ratios
are mentioned. See problems 23, 34, 35, 39 b, 41, and 50
(p. 90, sq. K. v. J an). The existenoe of the consonant ratios is
affirmed (xlx. 39 b: οἱ ἐν τῇ συμφωνία φθόγγοι λόγον ἔχουσι

κινήσεως πρὸς αὑτούς), and the ratios for the intervals of the
Octavo, Phth, and Fourth are eorrsotly given (35 ι διπλασία
ἡ νήτη τῆς ὑπάτης, οἷα ή νήτη δύο, ή ὑπάτη ἔν, καὶ οἷα ή
ὑπάτη δύο, ἡ νήτη τέσσαρα, καὶ ἀεὶ οὕτως· τῆς δὲ μέσης
ἡμιολία. And 41: Διὰ τί δὶς μὲν δι’ ὀξειῶν ἢ δὶς διὰ τεττά-
ρων οὐ συμφωνεῖ, δὶς διὰ πασῶν δίς-Ἢ ὅτι τὸμὲν διὰ πέντε
ἐστὶν ἐν ἡμιολίῳ λόγῳ, τὸ δὲ διὰ τεττάρων ἐν ἐπιτρίτῳ ,· . . . .
τὸ δὲ διὰ πασῶν ἐπειδή ἐστιν ἐν διπλασίῳ λόγῳ, τοτὲ).
Problems 23 and 50 describe experiments which show the
ratios. Aristotle‚ Probinus, xlx. 23 (p. 90 Κ. v. J ) Διὰ τί
διπλασία τῆς νήτης ἡ ὑπάτη (ἡ νήτη τῆς ὑπάτης οοᾶἀ.);-
Ἢ πρῶτον μὲν ὅτι ἐκ τοῦ ἡμίσεος ή χορδή φαλλομένη καὶ
ὅλη συμφωνοῦσι διὰ πασῶν. ὁμοίως δὲ ἔχει καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν
συρίγγων. ἡ γὰρ διὰ τοῦ μέσον τῆς σύριγγος τρήματος φωνή
τῇ δι’ ὅλης τῆς σάριγγος συμφωνεῖ διὰ πασῶν. ἔτι ἐντοῖς
